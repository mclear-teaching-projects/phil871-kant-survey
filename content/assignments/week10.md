With Kant&rsquo;s positive conception of cognition behind us, we turn this week to a
look at two issues. First, we close out the Analytic of Principles with a
discussion of phenomena and noumena. Second we start looking at Kant&rsquo;s broader
negative argument that constitutes the &ldquo;critique&rdquo; of reason proper. We&rsquo;ll look
at his conception of what the faculty of reason is, why it tends to lead us
into illusion, and the form of these illusions.
