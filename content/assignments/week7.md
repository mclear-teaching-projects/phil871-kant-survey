Once Kant has argued for which concepts should be considered the fundamental
concepts of metaphysics (as he did in the Metaphysical Deduction), he then
needs to argue that such concepts can legitimately be applied to what is given
in sensibility. This is the task of the (in)famous &ldquo;Transcendental Deduction
of the Categories.&rdquo; This week we&rsquo;ll look at the overall structure of the
Deduction, and consider the initial few sections in some detail.
