Hume famously presents a challenge to conceptions of causation as a kind of
necessitation relation. This week we look at Kant&rsquo;s general approach to
necessary connection in the temporal or &ldquo;schematized&rdquo; application of the
categories. In turn this leads to our central topic of discussion: the sense in
which Kant&rsquo;s position on time determination and the relation between inner
appearances and their outer cause(s) allows him to reply to the skeptical
positions of Descartes (problematic idealism) and Berkeley (dogmatic idealism).
We are joined for this discussion by our guest [Janum Sethi](https://www.janumsethi.com) (University of
Michigan).

Please note we are meeting at our usual time, but over **zoom** (info on the course discord).
