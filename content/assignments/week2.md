This week we discuss Kant&rsquo;s idealism concerning space and time. We&rsquo;ll try and
understand what it means to say that space and time are merely &ldquo;forms&rdquo; of
intuition, the arguments for the view, and how it stands up to relevant
alternatives.


## Readings {#readings}

-   CPR: Transcendental Aesthetic (B33-73; [Guyer & Wood, 172-92](https://www.dropbox.com/s/62c67l858hwrmeg/kant1998b%5Fthe%5Ftranscendental%5Faesthetic%5F%2528b-edition%2529.pdf?dl=0))
    -   We&rsquo;ll focus primarily on Kant&rsquo;s discussion of _space_
-   Prolegomena: §§6-10, §13 ([Hatfield 32-5, 37-8](static/materials/readings 1/kant-prolegomena-6-10-13.pdf))
-   Optional: Parsons, [The Transcendental Aesthetic](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pqu2fhedpn22e3c/parsons1992.pdf?dl=0)
    -   This is a class and helpful overview of the whole section, with a focus on space.
-   Optional: Janiak, [Kant&rsquo;s Views on Space and Time](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-spacetime/)
    -   Also a very helpful overview. Does a bit more than Parsons to situate Kant in the historical context of debates concerning space and time.
-   Optional: Shabel, [Kant&rsquo;s Argument from Geometry](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dgnpaacw4fez7ct/shabel2004.pdf?dl=0)
    -   Recent attempt to defend Kant against some classic objections concerning the structure of Kant&rsquo;s argument concerning space and Euclidean geometry.
-   Optional: Einstein, [Geometry and Experience](http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~ncrato/Math/Einstein.htm)
    -   Einstein&rsquo;s classic repudiation of a Kantian conception of space. The first sentence of the third paragraph is widely quoted and succictly states Einstein&rsquo;s differnce from Kant.
-   Optional: Allais, [Kant’s Argument for Transcendental Idealism in the Transcendental Aesthetic](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ogdrn3tp3s1par7/allais2010a%5Fkant%27s%5Fargument%5Ffor%5Ftranscendental%5Fidealism%5Fin%5Fthe%5Ftranscendental%5Faesthetic.pdf?dl=0)
    -   Helpful way of thinking about Kant&rsquo;s argument for Transcendental Idealism as deriving from his conception of the role of intuition in cognition.
