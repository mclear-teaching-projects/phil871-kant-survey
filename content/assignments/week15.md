We close our discussion of Kant&rsquo;s moral theory by looking at his
argument for freedom as autonomy in the third section of the _Groundwork_
and related passages from the _Critique of Practical Reason_. We&rsquo;ll try to
assess how Kant&rsquo;s strategy changes from the _Groundwork_ to the second
_Critique_ and whether one approach is better than the other philosophically.
