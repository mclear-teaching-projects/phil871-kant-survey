This week we&rsquo;ll continue our discussion of reason -- what is it?, why does it
lead us into illusion?, and is &ldquo;supreme principle&rdquo; of reason the same as (or a
restriction of) Leibniz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Principle of Sufficient Reason.&rdquo; Guest [Rosalind
Chaplin](http://rosalindchaplin.weebly.com) will help lead our discussion concerning these issues.
