In lieu of a passage analysis this week, please answer the following:

1.  What is the question of the book?
2.  How does Kant think we go about answering it?
3.  How do 1+2 explain the structure of the book?

There&rsquo;s no strict word limit, but this shouldn&rsquo;t really need much longer than 2-3 pages (and it could be as short as a paragraph).
