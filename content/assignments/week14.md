This week we look at Kant&rsquo;s famous division of practical imperatives into
those of hypothetical and categorical form. We&rsquo;ll discuss Kant&rsquo;s conception of
a will, how it acts on imperatives, and the broader conception of agency in
which this fits. We&rsquo;ll also look at the various formulations of the moral law,
and raise some questions concerning how they all fit together.
