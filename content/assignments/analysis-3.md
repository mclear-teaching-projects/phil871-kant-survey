In no more than 500 words describe Kant&rsquo;s argument or point in the passage in as plain English as possible. For this assignment please identify the argument of the passage. This means (i) identifying the conclusion or main claim of the passage; (ii) identifying the evidence Kant provides for that conclusion or claim. The analysis is due via [email](mailto:mclear@unl.edu) Friday, October 27 by 5 p.m.


## Passage 1 {#passage-1}

> Understanding belongs to all experience and its possibility, and the first thing that it does for this is not to make the representation of the objects distinct, but rather to make the representation of an object possible at all. Now this happens through its conferring temporal order on the appearances and their existence by assigning to each of these, as a consequence, a place in time determined _a priori_ in regard to the preceding appearances, without which it would not agree with time itself, which determines the position of all its parts _a priori_. Now this determination of position cannot be borrowed from the relation of the appearances to absolute time (for that is not an object of perception), but, conversely, the appearances themselves must determine their positions in time for each other, and make this determination in the temporal order necessary, i.e., that which follows or happens must succeed that which was contained in the previous state in accordance with a general rule, from which arises a series of appearances, in which by means of the understanding the very same order and constant connection in the series of possible perceptions is produced and made necessary as would be encountered _a priori_ in the form of inner experience (time), in which all perceptions would have to have their place. (B244-5)


## Passage 2 {#passage-2}

> Transcendental illusion, on the other hand, does not cease even though it is uncovered and its nullity is clearly seen into by transcendental criticism (e.g. the illusion in the proposition: &ldquo;The world must have a beginning in time&rdquo;). The cause of this is that in our reason (considered subjectively as a human faculty of cognition) there lie fundamental rules and maxims for its use, which look entirely like objective principles, and through them it comes about that the subjective necessity of a certain connection of our concepts on behalf of the understanding is taken for an objective necessity, the determination of things in themselves. [This is] an illusion that cannot be avoided at all, just as little as we can avoid it that the sea appears higher in the middle than at the shores, since we see the former through higher rays of light than the latter, or even better, just as little as the astronomer can prevent the rising moon from appearing larger to him, even when he is not deceived by this illusion (A297/B253-54)
