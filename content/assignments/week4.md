This week we continue our discussion of Kant&rsquo;s doctrine of Transcendental
Idealism. We&rsquo;ll focus primarily on his inference from the a priori and intuitive
status of our representation of space and time to the conclusion that space and
time themselves are mind-dependent. We&rsquo;ll also look at various options for
interpreting Kant&rsquo;s positions on idealism and realism.

If there is time we may discuss briefly Kant&rsquo;s derivation of the categories and
how this conception of the categories might provide a further basis for Kant&rsquo;s
idealism (see optional reading).
