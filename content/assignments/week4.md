Kant&rsquo;s project of defending our knowledge of true synthetic a priori judgments
in metaphysics requires a defense of the legitimacy of the basic concepts of
metaphysics. But which concepts are the most basic? This week we&rsquo;ll look at
the section of the _Critique of Pure Reason_ called the &ldquo;Metaphysical
Deduction&rdquo;, in which Kant gives us an argument for determining which concepts
are fundamental to metaphysics, and how they could be cognized a priori.
