Kant&rsquo;s project of defending our knowledge of true synthetic a priori judgments
in metaphysics requires a defense of the legitimacy of the basic concepts of
metaphysics. But which concepts are the most basic? This week we start our
discussion of the Transcendental Analytic with a look at the section of the
_Critique of Pure Reason_ called the &ldquo;Metaphysical Deduction&rdquo;, in which Kant
gives us an argument for determining which concepts are fundamental to
metaphysics, and how they could be cognized a priori.
