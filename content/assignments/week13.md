We begin our discussion of Kant&rsquo;s moral theory by looking at his
argument for freedom as autonomy in the third section of the _Groundwork_
and related passages from the _Critique of Practical Reason_. Joining us for our discussion is [Jessica Tizzard](https://philpeople.org/profiles/jessica-tizzard), and we&rsquo;ll be looking at some forthcoming work from her on these issues as well (see the Discord thread for her paper).

## Questions {#questions}

-   Why is freedom a property of all rational wills?
-   What does it mean to say that the will is &rsquo;autonomous&rsquo;?
-   Why think that an autonomous will must be a good will?
-   In what sense does Kant meant to provide a proof of the moral law in section III?
-   What is the circle concerning the relationship between freedom and morality?
-   How does Kant think we can break out of the circle?
