We close out the semester by looking at one &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; issue in
Kant&rsquo;s critical philosophy---namely, how are theoretical and practical
reason related---i.e. what is the unity of these two faculties as
faculties of _reason_? We&rsquo;ll discuss this issue as it plays out in one of
his most famous popular essays -- &ldquo;What is Enlightenment.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll also
discuss what it means to say that practical reason has &ldquo;primacy&rdquo; over
theoretical reason.


## Readings {#readings}

-   _What is Enlightenment?_ in _Practical Philosophy_, 11-22

## Questions {#questions}

-   In what ways might we think of practical and theoretical reason as stemming
    from a &ldquo;common principle&rdquo;?
-   What does Kant argue it means to have &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo;?
-   What is it to think for oneself?
