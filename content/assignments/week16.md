The week we&rsquo;ll finish our discussion of _Groundwork III_ and Kant&rsquo;s two &rsquo;standpoints&rsquo;. We then close out the semester by looking at one &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; issue in Kant&rsquo;s critical philosophy---namely, how theoretical and practical reason are related. To what extent can we see theoretical inference and practical willing as exercises of a single faculty of reason? We&rsquo;ll discuss this issue as it plays out in one of his most famous popular essays -- &ldquo;What is Enlightenment.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll also discuss what it means to say that practical reason has &ldquo;primacy&rdquo; over theoretical reason.
