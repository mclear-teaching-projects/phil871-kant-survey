For our final week on the first _Critique_ we discuss Kant&rsquo;s Third Antinomy and
the various conceptions of freedom. In particular, we&rsquo;ll see how Kant aims to
secure the logical possibility that we are what he calls &ldquo;transcendentally
free.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll also look at how this view is developed in the _Critique of
Practical Reason_.
