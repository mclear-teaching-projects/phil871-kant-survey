This week we discuss further Kant&rsquo;s argument for construing space and time as mere forms of sensibility. We&rsquo;ll discuss his seeming inference from the putative fact that space and time are forms of sensibility to the conclusion that they are _only_ forms of sensibility and nothing &ldquo;in themselves&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ll also discuss some possibilities for interpreting the overall sense in which his position is &ldquo;idealist.&rdquo;
