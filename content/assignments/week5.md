We&rsquo;re finishing our discussion of Transcendental Idealism this week by looking more closely at epistemic readings of TI. Be sure to have read the below chapters by Allison, if you haven&rsquo;t already. Other things to look at include Van Cleve&rsquo;s criticisms of Allison&rsquo;s reading and Nick Stang&rsquo;s overview of issues surrounding the interpretation of Transcendental Idealism.

Note that class on the 20th will be ****remote**** via zoom, with guest Banafsheh Baizaei of Brown University (<https://philosophy.brown.edu/people/banafsheh-beizaei>).

The zoom link is on the week 5 channel on the class discord.
