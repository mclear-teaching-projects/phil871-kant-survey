Once Kant has argued for which concepts should be considered the fundamental
concepts of metaphysics (as he did in the Metaphysical Deduction), he then
needs to argue that such concepts can legitimately be applied to what is given
in sensibility. This is the task of the (in)famous &ldquo;Transcendental Deduction
of the Categories.&rdquo; This week we&rsquo;ll look at the overall structure of the
Deduction, and consider the initial few sections in some detail.

## Questions {#questions}

-   What is a &ldquo;deduction&rdquo; of the categories?
-   What special difficulty do the categories face that the intuitions of space and time and their related concepts did not?
-   What is the aim of the Transcendental Deduction?
-   Does the TD need to prove that external world skepticism is false if it is
    to succeed?
-   What does it mean to say that the TD has &ldquo;two steps&rdquo;?
-   What might the first step of the TD argue?
-   What is the &ldquo;original synthetic unity of apperception&rdquo; and why is it important?
