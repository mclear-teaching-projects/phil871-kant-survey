This is the homepage for **PHIL 871** -- Kant&rsquo;s Critical Philosophy.

This course provides an intensive study of the metaphysical, epistemological,
and moral doctrines of Kant&rsquo;s mature &ldquo;critical&rdquo; philosophy. Our discussion
covers three central themes of Kant&rsquo;s work: his conception of the nature and
limits of the rational mind; his critique of traditional metaphysics; and his
positive conception of morality as the expression of rational agency. Specific
topics covered include: the limits of human knowledge; the role of the mind in
the production of experience; the reality of space and time; the nature of
matter; reason and its ability to critique itself; knowledge of the self;
freedom of the will; the objectivity of morality; the existence of God; the
afterlife of the soul; the status of metaphysics; and the relationship between
&rsquo;appearances&rsquo; and &rsquo;ultimate reality&rsquo;
