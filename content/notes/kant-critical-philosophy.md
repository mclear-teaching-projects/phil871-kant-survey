In these notes I give a more extensive overview of some of the central features
of Immanual Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Critical&rdquo; philosophy&ldquo; than I did in the previous notes. We&rsquo;ll still have only a sketch, but at least the basic parts of Kant&rsquo;s theory of cognition should attain some clarity.

[Immanuel Kant](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/) (1724--1804)
was the most significant German philosopher of the eighteenth century,
and was a key figure in the
[Enlightenment](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/). He
wrote most of his most famous philosophical works relatively late in his
professional life, having only achieved a position as full professor in
1770, at the age of forty-six.[^fn:1] From 1781 to 1798 Kant published a
series of tremendously influential philosophical works, including the
_Critique of Pure Reason_ (1781/7), the _Groundwork of the Metaphysics
of Morals_ (1785), the _Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science_
(1786), the _Critique of Practical Reason_ (1788), and the _Critique of
the Power of Judgment_ (1790).

We&rsquo;ll be focusing on two key areas of Kant&rsquo;s philosophical corpus. The
first concerns the metaphysical and epistemological doctrines forming
the core of Kant&rsquo;s mature philosophy, as presented in the _Critique of
Pure Reason_ of 1781/87. The second concerns the basic principles of
Kant&rsquo;s moral philosophy in his _Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals_
of 1785. The moral philosophy is founded upon the important metaphysical
and epistemological positions articulated in the first _Critique_ so
that is we shall begin.


## <span class="section-num">1</span> The Project of the _Critique of Pure Reason_ {#the-project-of-the-critique-of-pure-reason}

There are certain aspects of Kant&rsquo;s project in the CPR there which
should be very familiar to anyone versed in the debates of seventeenth
century European philosophy. For example, Kant, like Locke and Hume,
wishes to articulate the nature and extent of human knowledge, and to do
so in a manner which proceeds from an analysis of the nature of human
cognitive capacities. Kant believes that human reason requires a
&rsquo;critique&rsquo; or examination as to whether it is fit to provide us with
knowledge. Kant ultimately argues that human reason is not fit to
provide us with knowledge of a mind-independent reality transcending
human experience. In this sense Kant is deeply sympathetic with
&rsquo;empiricist&rsquo; critiques by Locke, Berkeley, and Hume of &rsquo;rationalist&rsquo;
philosophers such as Descartes and Leibniz.[^fn:2]

However, Kant also argues that we have much deeper and more extensive
knowledge of the world we experience (or could possibly experience) than
his empiricist predecessors would allow. For example, Kant argues that
we have knowledge of necessary truths concerning aspects of the
empirical world (such as that every event in the empirical world has a
cause), as well as truths which are universal in extent. Thus Kant
articulates a view that is directly opposed to the kinds of skeptical
arguments Hume discusses in his _Treatise_ and first _Enquiry_.

Kant thus thinks that we have knowledge of the empirical world governed
by necessary and universal laws, while nevertheless being almost wholly
ignorant of the fundamental reality which underlies or grounds the
existence of the empirical world. In this way Kant combines various
aspects of both the traditional rationalist and empiricist positions.
Like Locke and Hume, Kant thinks we must realize that the boundaries of
human knowledge stop at experience, and thus that we must be
extraordinarily circumspect concerning any claim made about how reality
is like independent of all human experience. But, like Descartes and
Leibniz, Kant thinks that central parts of human knowledge nevertheless
exhibit characteristics of necessity and universality, and that,
contrary to Hume&rsquo;s skeptical arguments, we can have good reason to think
that they do.

Kant thus critiques pure reason in order to show its nature and limits,
and thereby curb the pretensions of various metaphysical systems
articulated on the basis of a firm faith that reason alone allows us to
scrutinize the very depths of reality. But Kant also argues that the
legitimate domain of reason is more extensive and more substantive than
previous empiricist critiques had allowed. In this way Kant salvages
much of the prevailing Enlightenment conception of reason as an organ
for knowledge of the world.

Below I characterize some of the central aspects of Kant&rsquo;s
epistemological framework and how that framework significantly
revolutionized our understanding of the possible nature and extent of
human knowledge.


## <span class="section-num">2</span> Two Kinds of Knowledge {#two-kinds-of-knowledge}


### <span class="section-num">2.1</span> Leibniz {#leibniz}

[Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/) (1646-1716) was the most significant German philosopher of the
seventeenth century. One of the central notions in Leibniz&rsquo;s philosophy
is that the logical structure of our thought mirrors the real structure
of reality. Leibniz thus thinks that there are close connections between
the nature of truth and the nature of substance. For example:

-   All truth is analytic truth by virtue of containment[^fn:3]
    -   in every true predication the concept of the predicate is contained
        in the concept of the subject

-   Substance is the ultimate subject of predication, and that which
    cannot be predicated of anything else

-   If x is a substance then there is a concept of x that contains all
    true predications concerning x[^fn:4]
    -   finite beings grasp truths about substances via partial grasp of
        their complete concept
    -   God knows all truths about all substances via a perfect grasp of
        their complete concepts

Take, for example, the historical figure
[Julius Caesar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_caesar). According
to Leibniz, the statement &rsquo;Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC&rsquo; is
analytically true. An &rsquo;_analytic truth_&rsquo;, for Leibniz, is a truth whose
predicate does not, in some sense, go beyond what is given in stating
the subject. There are obvious &rsquo;stutter&rsquo; examples of this --- &rsquo;all red
squares are red&rsquo; is analytically true since the predicate is so clearly
part of the subject. But the same phenomena can occur covertly. For
example, the statement &rsquo;Bachelors are unmarried men&rsquo; is analytically
true because part of what it is to be (or for the word &rsquo;Bachelor&rsquo; to
mean) a bachelor is to be an unmarried man.

Leibniz thinks that _all_ truth is analytic. So with our initial example
statement &rsquo;Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC&rsquo;, Leibniz thinks that the
relation between the subject (&rsquo;Caesar&rsquo;) and the predicate (&rsquo;crossed the
Rubicon in 49 BC&rsquo;) is relevantly similar to the relation in the case of
the &rsquo;bachelor&rsquo; example. For any individual substance, Leibniz thinks
there is a singular concept which picks it out and which &rsquo;contains&rsquo; all
the predicates of the substance (past, present, and future) in just the
same way that &rsquo;bachelor&rsquo; contains &rsquo;is an unmarried man&rsquo;.

Thus, if the world is the totality of individual substances, God
possesses a concept of each individual substance, and knows everything
that is, has been, or will be true of that individual. This is discussed
by Leibniz mostly clearly in his
[_Discourse on
Metaphysics_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfs/leibniz1686d.pdf) (see §§8-16).


### <span class="section-num">2.2</span> Hume {#hume}

[David Hume](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/) (1711-1776) was
one of the major figures of the so-called &rsquo;Scottish Enlightenment&rsquo;,
which centered around Edinburgh. Kant credits a reading of Hume around
1769 with awakening him from his &rsquo;dogmatic slumbers&rsquo; and instigating him
to develop the metaphysical and epistemological doctrines of the first
_Critique_. It is likely that Kant&rsquo;s reading of Hume was based on
excerpts from Hume&rsquo;s 1748 work, _An Enquiry Concerning Human
Understanding_. Section 4 of the _Enquiry_ introduces what is now known
as &rsquo;Hume&rsquo;s Fork&rsquo;. This is the division of all reasoning into two
categories---viz. relations of ideas and matters of fact.[^fn:5] Hume
argues that certainty, justification independent of experience, and
knowledge of necessity cannot be had with respect to anything in the
empirical world.


#### <span class="section-num">2.2.1</span> Relations of Ideas {#relations-of-ideas}

Hume describes the knowledge we have by means of perceiving relations
between ideas as such that it can be had

> by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is
> anywhere existent in the universe. Though there never were a circle or
> triangle in nature, the truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever
> retain their certainty and evidence. (E IV.i.1)

Knowledge of relations between ideas is certain, necessary (its denial
entails a contradiction), universal, and justified independently of any
experience. Hume thinks that all our knowledge of mathematics and logic
falls into this category. Importantly, according to Hume such knowledge
gives us no insight into how things actually are in the empirical world.
That is the cost of our being able to have such knowledge purely by
thinking.

Using Leibniz&rsquo;s terminology, Hume is arguing that knowledge of relations
between ideas is _analytic_ and _a priori_. Moreover, Hume is giving a
_reductive_ account of the a priori in terms of relations between ideas.
His explanation of how it is that we can know the truth of some
proposition a priori, is that the truth depends on a relation between
the ideas constitutive of the proposition (e.g. All red things are red;
All bachelors are unmarried), and that we can know the propositions are
true simply in virtue of possessing the relevant ideas.

However, Hume and Leibniz radically disagree concerning the _extent_ of
analytic truth and our a priori knowledge. Recall that Leibniz construes
all truth as analytic, in the sense that all truth depends on the
predicate&rsquo;s being &rsquo;contained&rsquo; in the subject. So, for any true judgment,
there is in principle an analysis of the subject concept in which it can
be shown that the predicate of the judgment is part of (or &rsquo;contained
in&rsquo;) the subject&rsquo;s complete concept. Hume, in contrast, has no robust
theory truth (at least in a sense which Leibniz would recognize), and
certainly does not attempt to explain all truth in terms of containment.
The reason we have a priori knowledge of relation of ideas is because we
(i) have privileged access to those ideas, and (ii) the knowledge we
have of relations between ideas is parasitic on our knowledge of the
meanings or content of the ideas, and not anything else. Hence one can
know that _all triangles have three sides_ is true and necessarily so,
just in virtue of knowing what &rsquo;triangle&rsquo; means.


#### <span class="section-num">2.2.2</span> Matters of Fact {#matters-of-fact}

In contrast to knowledge of relations between ideas, Hume argues that
our knowledge of matters of fact is contingent (its denial is not a
contradiction), local, uncertain, and dependent for its justification on
empirical inquiry. Examples of knowledge of matters of fact include such
propositions as the number of houses on one&rsquo;s street, the names of one&rsquo;s
parents, the identity of the current President of the United States, and
the atomic weight of gold. Knowledge of all of these propositions
requires that we consult how things actually are in the world. In none
of these cases can we earn the knowledge merely by thinking.

In the terminology of Leibniz and (after Hume) Kant, knowledge of
matters of fact is _synthetic_ and _a posteriori_. It is justified only
by current or past experience and cannot be attained purely by any
process of conceptual analysis. Hume is thus taking up a diametrically
opposed position to that of Leibniz, who argued that knowledge of
empirical matters of fact _can_ be obtained via conceptual analysis of
the complete concepts of the substances constituting the actual world.
It may be the case that _we_ cannot complete such an analysis, but one
is in principle available (to God).

Hume&rsquo;s fork results in the position that there is no substantive
knowledge of the empirical world that we can have via analysis of our
ideas (i.e. our concepts) alone. All empirical knowledge including,
e.g. knowledge in the physical sciences, is knowledge of matters of
fact, and is thus contingent, local, and uncertain. Hume attempts to
drive this conclusion home by arguing that the process of reasoning by
means of cause/effect relationships has no ultimate rational basis, and
thus cannot give us knowledge of how things are beyond our current or
remembered experience. We&rsquo;ll turn to an examination of that argument
now.


## <span class="section-num">3</span> Kant on the A Priori {#kant-on-the-a-priori}

We&rsquo;ve seen that several philosophers argue that there are kinds of
knowledge that may be had just by thinking, or are universal and
necessary in scope. Hume&rsquo;s conception of knowledge made this especially
clear. According to Hume, knowledge of necessary and universal truths
must be a function purely of knowledge of the relations of ideas.

Kant agrees with Hume that a priori knowledge is independent of
experience. In fact, he sees it as definitive of &rsquo;pure&rsquo; a priori
knowledge that it be completely independent of experience. He contrasts
such knowledge with &rsquo;empirical&rsquo; knowledge or knowledge a posteriori. A
priori knowledge may be more or less &rsquo;pure&rsquo; according to whether or not
the concepts which make it up are themselves a priori knowable. Kant
uses the example &rsquo;ever alteration has a cause&rsquo; as an example of _impure_
a priori knowledge, since the concept &lt;alteration&gt; is empirical.

One important point about Kant&rsquo;s use of &rsquo;independence&rsquo; in describing the
a priori. Kant does not think that a priori knowledge is independent of
experience in the sense that one need have _no_ experience in order to
have the knowledge. On the contrary, Kant thinks that _all_ of our
knowledge depends on our having experience of some kind or another,
though he doesn&rsquo;t think this dependence entails that all our judgments
are ultimately _justified_ by experience. This is why Kant says that

> although all our cognition commences _with_ experience, yet it does
> not on that account all arise _from_ experience. For it could well be
> that even our experiential cognition is a composite of that which we
> receive through impressions and that which our own cognitive faculty
> (merely prompted by sensible impressions) provides out of itself,
> which addition we cannot distinguish from that fundamental material
> until long practice has made us attentive to it and skilled in
> separating it out. (B1-2)

There seems to be two reasons for Kant&rsquo;s thinking this. First, we need
experience in order for our cognitive faculties to function and develop.
Second, we may need particular experiences in order to acquire certain
concepts (e.g. red experiences in order to acquire the concept &lt;red&gt;).
This is what distinguishes pure from impure a priori judgments. Impure a
priori judgments are partially constituted by concepts which themselves
must come from experience.

If a priori knowledge is, for Kant, knowledge that is (in some sense to
be further specified) independent of experience, that fact is not the
only mark or indicator that some bit of knowledge is a priori. In
addition, Kant argues, any bit of knowledge that is necessary and/or
universal in scope is itself a priori.

> Experience teaches us, to be sure, that something is constituted thus
> and so, but not that it could not be otherwise. **First**, then, if a
> proposition is thought along with its **necessity**, it is an _a priori_
> judgment; if it is, moreover, also not derived from any proposition
> except one that in turn is valid as a necessary proposition, then it
> is absolutely _a priori_. **Second**: Experience never gives its
> judgments true or strict but only assumed and comparative
> **universality** (through induction)...Necessity and strict universality
> are therefore secure indications of an _a priori_ cognition (B3-4)

Kant argues that the conception of a priori knowledge is presupposed in
many empirical judgments as well as in particular sciences. He
specifically points to mathematics (&rsquo;5+7=12&rsquo;) and to physical judgments
(&rsquo;every alteration has a cause&rsquo;). One of Kant&rsquo;s arguments (which he
hints at in §III of the Introduction) is that all of our empirical
knowledge (even that knowledge which we think we have unproblematically)
presupposes a priori knowledge.

Kant thinks that there are many examples of judgments which we claim to
know a priori, but he is interested primarily in a specific subset of
those which constitute the subject matter of _metaphysics_---viz.
judgments concerning God, the soul (or mind), and immortality. One of
Kant&rsquo;s primary aims is to determine whether metaphysical knowledge of
such things is possible, and if it is possible, what the extent and
nature of that knowledge might be. Metaphysical knowledge is
problematic, Kant argues, because unlike other forms of a priori
knowledge, such as logic and mathematics, it is not at all obvious which
metaphysical judgments are in fact correct and thus known, and which are
merely thought to be so. This is exemplified, Kant thinks, by the
contentious disputes in which philosophers have long been involved. Kant
thus hopes that, by giving a critique of reason, he can demonstrate the
extent to which metaphysics might count as a science, and thus rest on a
secure set of claims.


### <span class="section-num">3.1</span> The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction {#the-analyticsynthetic-distinction}

A judgment is known (or knowable) a priori if it is known independently
of experience. Kant thinks that this is not the only dimension according
to which one can analyze a judgment. Kant argues that all judgments, in
addition to being classifiable as either a priori or a posteriori (or
empirical), may also be classified as being either
[analytic or
synthetic](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/).

An analytic judgment is, according to Kant, one in which the predicate
is &rsquo;contained&rsquo; in the concept. One way of understanding this notion of
&rsquo;containment&rsquo; is via a claim about meaning. Accordingly, analytic
judgments are those whose truth is known merely in virtue of knowing the
meanings of the concepts constituting the judgment. For example, in the
judgment &rsquo;All bachelors are unmarried&rsquo; the concept &lt;unmarried&gt; is part
of the meaning of &lt;bachelor&gt; and so the truth of the judgment is grasped
just by knowing the relevant meanings.

Kant also introduces several other markers of analyticity, four in
total. He says that in an analytic judgment

1.  The predicate is &rsquo;contained&rsquo; within the subject (A6-7/B11)
2.  The predicate is &rsquo;identical&rsquo; with the subject (A7/B11)
3.  Analytic judgments are ones which are &rsquo;explicative&rsquo; rather than
    &rsquo;ampliative&rsquo; (A7/B11)
4.  Analytic judgments are those knowable by means of application of the
    principle of non-contradiction (A151/B190)

Which, if any of these markers is best thought of as the main
characteristic of an analytic judgment? This is a disputed issue (cf.
@anderson2005; @proops2005), though certainly, in all cases Kant is
thinking of &rsquo;atomic&rsquo; judgments of subject-predicate form.


#### <span class="section-num">3.1.1</span> Containment Analyticity {#containment-analyticity}

Kant defines analyticity in terms of containment this way:

> the predicate B belongs to the subject A as something that is
> (covertly) contained in this concept A (A6/B10)

Kant distinguishes two distinct notion of logical containment---viz. the
&ldquo;content&rdquo; and the &ldquo;extension&rdquo; of a concept. These notions are
&rsquo;intesional&rsquo; they concern what is thought &rsquo;in&rsquo; the concept and not what
objects fall under the concept (this would be, for Kant, a non-logical
notion of &rsquo;extension&rsquo;). The _content_ of a concept is the group of
intensional concepts (marks) that it &ldquo;contains in&rdquo; itself as components,
whereas the concept&rsquo;s logical _extension_ comprises the group of lower,
or more specific, concepts it &ldquo;contains under&rdquo; itself (_Jäsche Logic_,
9:95--7, esp. §§ 8, 9, 11).[^fn:6] Kant conceives of concept
individuation along the broadly Aristotelian lines of a logic of terms.
Concepts (or terms) fall under some general _genus_ and are
distinguished from other concepts falling under the genus in terms of
specific _differentia_. For example, the concept `<human>` falls under
the genus `<animal>` and is distinguished from other animals by its
differentia---viz. `<rational>`.

Divisions are exclusive and exhaustive disjunctions of everything that
falls under the genus.[^fn:7] Thus two points apply:

1.  The division of a genus is _complete_ --- the various species of a
    genus, taken together, _exhaust_ the genus.
2.  Membership in a species is _exclusive_ --- no species may be
    predicated of another.

Content and extension are related to one another _reciprocally_. If we
conceive of concepts as organized hierarchically, as on a
[Porphyrian Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrian_tree), then
the content of a concept A is everything _above_ it in the concept
hierarchy (i.e. every concept which constitutes A) and the extension of
the concept is everything _below_ it in the hierarchy (i.e. every
concept which contains A as a proper part).

Kant also holds that,

> In regard to the logical extension of concepts, the following
> universal rules hold 1. What belongs to or contradicts higher concepts
> also belongs to or contradicts all lower concepts that are contained
> under those higher ones; and 2. conversely: What belongs to or
> contradicts all lower concepts also belongs to or contradicts their
> higher concept. (_Jäsche Logic_, 9:981)

This means that concept with the same logical extension must contain the
same conceptual &rsquo;marks&rsquo; as content. They also must exclude the very same
marks that &rsquo;contradict&rsquo; the content or extension of the concept. Kant
calls concepts that share the same content and extension in this way
&rsquo;convertible&rsquo; or &rsquo;reciprocal&rsquo; concepts [/Wechselbegriffe/] (JL 9:98,
also 24:261, 755, 912).[^fn:8]

The rules of division thereby guarantee that the concepts constituting
the content of a further concept are all completely distinct from one
another ( i.e. they occupy different points on a Porphyrian hierarchy).
Thus, for one concept to &rsquo;contain&rsquo; another is to have that concept as a
member of its extension in a strict hierarchical ordering of
genus/species relationships where concepts are distinguished according
to their (non-overlapping) differentia. Conceptual analysis then
involves an explication of the conceptual marks constituting the content
of a concept sufficient for locating it at a specific place in some such
hierarchy. The rules of conceptual division are thus sufficient for
guaranteeing that hierarchy encodes only analyticities.

Any attempt to build a science via conceptual analysis would thus be an
attempt to construct a complete logical ordering of concepts according
to the division rules explained above. Such a division would make the
inferential relationships between concepts totally transparent, and thus
provide a totally clear and demonstrative science of whatever subject
matter was considered fit for analysis. So Kant&rsquo;s denial, in his
critical philosophy, that conceptual analysis provides us with any
substantive knowledge of reality is best understood as denying that the
explication of conceptual hierarchies via logical division provides us
with substantive knowledge. One of Kant&rsquo;s key insights was that at least
some of our knowledge has an importantly _non-logical_ basis. For
example, as we will see, the traditional logic of concepts lacks the
expressive power necessary to represent our knowledge of mathematics
(arithmetic and geometry) and Kant took this fact as a significant
reason in favor of his view that we must therefore have synthetic a
priori knowledge.[^fn:9]

</div>


### <span class="section-num">3.2</span> The Synthetic A Priori {#the-synthetic-a-priori}

Kant argues, in ways similar to Locke, Hume, and Leibniz, that analytic
judgments are knowable a priori. Staying with the &rsquo;containment&rsquo;
metaphor, since the predicate is contained in the subject of an analytic
judgment, there is no need to look beyond the judgment to the world (so
to speak) in order to determine the truth value of the judgment. In this
Kant is obviously in agreement with Locke, Hume, and Leibniz. Kant
agrees with his empiricist predecessors in claiming that all a
posteriori judgments are synthetic. Since the predicate is adding
something new to the subject we must look beyond the judgment to the
world---what we can experience---in order that we might determine the
relevant judgments truth or falsity.

Kant&rsquo;s main innovation to the a priori/posteriori and analytic/synthetic
schemas is to note that the analytic a priori and the synthetic a
posteriori do not exhaust the realm of possible judgments. There are
also _synthetic a priori_ judgments that are possible. Kant argues that
causal judgments are a clear example.

> Take the proposition &rsquo;Everything that happens has its cause&rsquo;...the
> concept of of a cause lies entirely outside [the concept of event] and
> indicates something different than the concept of what happens in
> general, and is therefore not contained in the latter representation
> at all. How then do I come to say something quite different about that
> which happens in general, and to cognize the concept of cause as
> belonging to it, indeed necessarily, even though not contained in it?
> What is the unknown _=X_ here on which the understanding depends when
> it believes itself to discover beyond the concept of _A_ a predicate
> that is foreign to it yet which it nevertheless believes to be
> connected with it? (A9/B13)

Kant argues here that our judgments concerning events presuppose that
they do not just _occur_ but are _caused to occur_, that we know this to
be true necessarily and universally, and that we have no explanation of
this fact unless the judgments we make in such cases are synthetic a
priori judgments. The question remains, however, just how such synthetic
a priori judgments could be possible. What is it that could link the
concepts in a subject-predicate judgment such that the truth of the
judgment holds necessarily and universally, while its nevertheless being
true that the predicate is not contained in the subject of the judgment,
and thus that the judgment is not analytic?

Kant argues that we need to explain how synthetic a priori judgments are
possible, and that the explanation of the possibility of significant
portions of our knowledge rests on this, including mathematics and
natural science, as well as the very possibility of metaphysics.


### <span class="section-num">3.3</span> Mathematics and the Synthetic A Priori {#mathematics-and-the-synthetic-a-priori}

Recall that for Hume, mathematical knowledge was a function merely of
knowledge of relations of ideas, in other words, that math is analytic
and a priori. Kant disputes this. Our mathematical knowledge is
certainly a priori, he thinks, but it is not explained in terms of
relations of ideas or concepts (i.e. in terms of containment or any of
the other marks of analyticity). Instead, Kant argues that mathematical
knowledge must be _synthetic_, but since it is necessary and universal,
also _a priori_.

> **Mathematical judgments are all synthetic**. This proposition seems to
> have escaped the notice of the analysts of human reason until now,
> indeed to be diametrically opposed to all of their conjectures,
> although it is incontrovertibly certain and has very important
> consequences. (A10/B14)

Kant uses two examples in his argument concerning mathematics. The first
is the judgment &rsquo;7+5=12&rsquo; and the second is the geometric judgment that
&rsquo;the shortest distance between two points is a straight line&rsquo;. Though
both judgments are knowable a priori, Kant thinks that in neither of
these two cases, can we explain the truth of the judgments analytically.

> one might initially think that the proposition &ldquo;7 + 5 = 12&rdquo; is a
> merely analytic proposition that follows from the concept of a sum of
> seven and five in accordance with the principle of contradiction. Yet
> if one considers it more closely, one finds that the concept of the
> sum of 7 and 5 contains nothing more than the unification of both
> numbers in a single one, through which it is not at all thought what
> this single number is which comprehends the two of them. The concept
> of twelve is by no means already thought merely by my thinking of that

Kant&rsquo;s argument here is that while it might be analytically true that
the sum of 7 and 5 is _a number_ (and also that it must be a _natural
number_), it is not clear from analysis alone that the sum is equal to
12, or any other pair of natural numbers which might sum to 12.

Kant seems to think that to the extent one finds the answer twelve
_obvious_ one is adverting, either explicitly or implicitly, to some
particular experience of adding units, such as counting on one&rsquo;s
fingers, or adding up objects (e.g. apples, chairs, blocks, etc.).

Also, if &rsquo;7+5=12&rsquo; is known analytically, then in thinking it one is
equivalently thinking of any or all the numbers which are equal to 12,
including _very large_ numbers (e.g. any numbers _m_ and _n_ which might
yield 12). This certainly doesn&rsquo;t reflect our experience when
calculating such sums, which may yield further evidence that the
judgment isn&rsquo;t analytically true.


## <span class="section-num">4</span> Kant&rsquo;s &rsquo;Copernican Revolution&rsquo; {#kants-copernican-revolution}

In a famous passage Kant compares his critical philosophy to the central
contribution of Nicolas Copernicus.

> Up to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must conform to
> the objects; but all attempts to find out something about them a
> priori through concepts that would extend our cognition have, on this
> presupposition, come to nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do
> not get farther with the problems of metaphysics by assuming that the
> objects must conform to our cognition, which would agree better with
> the requested possibility of an a priori cognition of them, which is
> to establish something about objects before they are given to us. This
> would be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus , who, when he did
> not make good progress in the explanation of the celestial motions if
> he assumed that the entire celestial host revolves around the
> observer, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made
> the observer revolve and left the stars at rest. (Bxvi--xvii)

So just as Copernicus sought to explain the apparent motions of objects
in the heavens in terms of the movement of the earthbound observer, so
too Kant attempts to account for the apparently characteristics of
objects in terms of our cognitive faculties and the cognitive conditions
under which we know the objective world. In Kantian phrase, instead of
assuming that our knowledge of the object must conform it _it_, we
assume that it conforms to _our knowledge_.


### <span class="section-num">4.1</span> Transcendental Idealism {#transcendental-idealism}

Kant&rsquo;s name for the position he articulates according to which objects
must conform to our way of knowing them &rsquo;Transcendental Idealism&rsquo;.
Though the exact meaning of Transcendental Idealism is much disputed by
Kant&rsquo;s interpreters, it is clear that he intends at least two things by
it.

First, according to Transcendental Idealism, space and time are neither
independent subsisting entities (as was suggested by Newton), nor
object-dependent orders of relations between entities (as was argued by
Leibniz). Instead, they are mind-dependent &rsquo;forms of intuition&rsquo;. They
are the characteristic ways in which we experience things rather than
independent things that we experience, or relations between things that
we experience. Space and time are &rsquo;empirically real&rsquo; --- they are
fundamental features of the empirical world that we experience. But they
are not real &rsquo;in themselves&rsquo;. They have no ultimate reality apart from
subjective experience.

Second, in addition to the transcendental ideality of space and time, to
which all experienced objects must conform, Kant argues that empirical
reality is itself structured by a privileged set of a priori concepts.

> Yet because I cannot stop with these intuitions, if they are to become
> cognitions, but must refer them as representations to something as
> their object and determine this object through them, I can assume
> either that the concepts through which I bring about this
> determination also conform to the objects, and then I am once again in
> the same difficulty about how I could know anything about them a
> priori, or else I assume that the objects, or what is the same thing,
> the experience in which alone they can be cognized (as given objects)
> conforms to those concepts, in which case I immediately see an easier
> way out of the difficulty, since experience itself is a kind of
> cognition requiring the understanding, whose rule I have to presuppose
> in myself before any object is given to me, hence a priori, which rule
> is ex- pressed in concepts a priori, to which all objects of
> experience must therefore necessarily conform, and with which they
> must agree. (Bxvii-viii)

Kant here argues that the object which appear to one in perceptual
experience, or &rsquo;intuition&rsquo; as he calls it, also must conform to our
basic conceptual scheme. He explains what he means here in the last
sentence: objects must conform to our conceptual scheme because that
scheme makes possible the experience of them.

We&rsquo;ll discuss Kant&rsquo;s &rsquo;Copernican&rsquo; strategy here in another class.
However, the basic idea is that Kant will show that what makes synthetic
a priori knowledge possible is the structure of our cognitive faculties
including the pure forms of intuition and a privileged set of a priori
concepts. These forms and concepts jointly make experience possible and
allow us to draw inferences that hold with necessity and universality
concerning objects encountered in experience. What&rsquo;s more, Kant argues
that because a priori concepts are necessary for experience in general,
we can know that those concepts are applied legitimately, since he is
taking it as obvious that we have experience. While we won&rsquo;t have time
to explore all of Kant&rsquo;s arguments for this position, we will explore
one---viz. his argument that we can know with certainty that, in
opposition to Hume, necessary causal connections really hold between
distinct objects or events, and thus that lawful scientific knowledge of
objects is possible.

[^fn:2]: As important as these British and French figures were, Kant was
    in fact most deeply engaged with German thinkers. By far one of
    the most important of these figures was
    [Christian
    Wolff](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/) (1679-1754), who was perhaps the most famous philosopher
    in Germany prior to Kant. In general, the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>
    century German philosophical scene was extremely vibrant. For a
    helpful overview see the

[^fn:3]: in every true affirmative proposition, whether necessary or
    contingent, universal or particular, the notion of the predicate
    is in some way included in that of the subject. _Praedicatum in

[^fn:4]: it is the nature of an individual substance or complete being to
    have a concept so complete that it is sufficient to make us
    understand and deduce from it all the predicates of the subject
    to which the concept is attributed. An accident, on the other
    hand, is a being whose concept does not include everything that
    can be attributed to the subject to which the concept is
    attributed (DM §8; L 307)
[^fn:5]: The division of truths in this way was quite widely held in the
    seventeenth century.

    (1625-1695) draw a similar distinction in their extremely
    influential work, _Logic, or the Art of Thinking_ (also known as
    the _Port Royal Logic_) of 1662. The influential Cartesian,
    [Nicolas
    Malebranche](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/malebranche/) (1638-1715), also makes a somewhat modified
    (because tripartite) version of the distinction in his 1674-5
    masterwork _The Search After Truth_. Many of the arguments
    Malebranche gives there prefigure the empiricist epistemologies
    of Berkeley and Hume, and were likely disseminated in Britain by
    the &rsquo;English Malebranche&rsquo;,
