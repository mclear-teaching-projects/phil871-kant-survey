## The Problem with A Priori Concepts

Kant's mature philosophical system is notable for the strictures it sets
on the kind of cognition and knowledge human beings (or finite rational
beings more generally) can achieve through reason alone. Importantly,
Kant thinks that pure reason can achieve relatively little on its own.
All of our ampliative knowledge that is also necessary and universal
consists in what Kant calls 'synthetic a priori' judgments or
propositions. The central question he then pursues concerns how
knowledge of such synthetic a priori propositions is possible. [We
previously
discussed](https://phil871.colinmclear.net/notes/transcendental-aesthetic)
Kant's arguments concerning the role (the representations of) space and
time play in grounding necessary and universal mathematical cognition
and knowledge. On Kant's view, mathematical cognition is synthetic
because it goes beyond mere conceptual analysis to deal with the
structure of (our representation of) space itself. It is a priori
because the structure of (our representation of) space is a priori
accessible to us, being merely the form of our intuition and not a real
mind independent thing (i.e. a 'thing in itself').

However, recall from our discussion of [transcendental
idealism](https://phil871.colinmclear.net/notes/kant-copernican-revolution/#transcendental-idealism)
that, in addition to the representation of space and time, Kant also
thinks that possession of a particular privileged set of a priori
concepts is necessary for knowledge of the empirical world. But this
raises a problem. How could an a priori concept, which is not itself
derived from any experience, be nevertheless legitimately applicable to
objects of experience? To make things even more difficult, it is not the
mere possibility of the application of a priori concepts to objects of
experience that worries Kant, for this could just be a matter of pure
luck. Kant requires more than the mere possibility of application, for
he wants to show that with regard to a privileged set of a priori
concepts, they apply necessarily and universally to all objects of
experience and do so in a way that we are in a position to know a
priori.

Kant's strategy for demonstrating how this is possible hinges on showing
that the experience of objects that he thinks all would agree that we
have nevertheless depends on the application of a priori concepts---the
categories. Kant makes this clear in his elaboration of his 'Copernican
Turn' in philosophy:

> because I cannot stop with these intuitions, if they are to become
> cognitions, but must refer them as representations to something as
> their object and determine this object through them, I can assume
> either that the concepts through which I bring about this
> determination also conform to the objects, and then I am once again in
> the same difficulty about how I could know anything about them *a
> priori*, or else I assume that the objects, or what is the same thing,
> the *experience* in which alone they can be cognized (as given
> objects) conforms to those concepts, in which case I immediately see
> an easier way out of the difficulty, since experience itself is a kind
> of cognition requiring the understanding, whose rule I have to
> presuppose in myself before any object is given to me, hence *a
> priori*, which rule is expressed in concepts *a priori*, to which all
> objects of experience must therefore necessarily conform, and with
> which they must agree. (CPR Preface, Bxvii)

Kant's strategy is thus to show how a priori concepts legitimately apply
to their objects in virtue of being partly constitutive of the objects
of experience, rather than the traditional view in which the objects of
experience are the ground of our concepts. Now, what exactly this means
is deeply contested, at least partly because it is rather unclear what
Kant intends us to understand by his Transcendental Idealism. For
example, does Kant intend that the objects of experience are
*themselves* nothing other than representations? This would be a form of
phenomenalism similar to that offered by
[Berkeley](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/). Kant, however,
seems to want to deny that his view is similar to Berkeley's, asserting
instead that the objects of experience really exist independently of the
mind, and that it is only the *way* that they are experienced that is
mind-dependent.

> the fact that I have myself given to this theory of mine the name of
> transcendental idealism cannot justify anyone in confusing it with the
> empirical idealism of *Descartes* (although this idealism was only a
> problem, whose insolubility left everyone free, in *Descartes*'
> opinion, to deny the existence of the corporeal world, since the
> problem could never be answered satisfactorily) or with the mystical
> and visionary idealism of *Berkeley* (against which, along with other
> similar fantasies, our *Critique*, on the contrary, contains the

> that they are not things (but mere ways of representing), nor are they
> determinations that belong to things in themselves. (*Prolegomena*
> §13, Note III; 4:293)

I'm mostly going to set this issue to the side in what follows. But the
issue of idealism is important to consider, insofar as Kant takes
himself to be replying to Hume's arguments about the nature of the
empirical world and the nature and extent of our knowledge of it.

## What Is a Transcendental Deduction?

In order to prove that there are a priori concepts which legitimately
apply to the objects of experience, Kant articulates [a special sort of
argument](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental/), which
he calls a 'transcendental deduction'. As Henrich (1989) points out, the
notion of a 'deduction' that Kant uses, is a legal one intended to
provide a historical justification for the legitimacy of a property
claim. In Kant's case however, it is transformed into a justification of
the applicability (in the sense discussed above) of the a priori
concepts Kant calls the 'categories'. These are the concepts given in
Kant's 'Table of Categories' (A80/B106); they are Unity, Plurality, and
Totality (the Categories of Quantity); Reality, Negation, and Limitation
(the Categories of Quality); Inherence and Subsistence, Causality and
Dependence, and Community (the Categories of Relation), and
Possibility-Impossibility, Existence-Nonexistence, Necessity-Contingency
(the Categories of Modality).

With regard to each category, Kant's aim is to show that it has
'objective validity'---i.e. legitimate applicability to the objects of
experience. Disputes concerning various members of the table should be
familiar. Hume famously disputes the legitimacy of our concept *cause*.
Hume thinks (in Kant's terms) that no 'empirical deduction' of the
concept is possible---i.e. that the concept cannot be traced to the
occurrence of a corresponding impression. Kant concurs with Hume on this
point---that there can be no empirical deduction---but argues that this
doesn't show that the concept is illegitimate, for it may be both a
priori and legitimately applied in virtue of being a necessary condition
of experience.

For Kant then a 'transcendental deduction' starts from a premise
concerning some feature of human experience, a premise which reasonable
interlocutors might be expected to endorse, and then argues to a
substantive philosophical conclusion concerning the presuppositions or
necessary conditions of the truth of that premise. Since Kant's concern
here is the a priori categories, his aim is to show that a
presupposition or necessary condition of some relatively uncontroversial
feature of experience is the applicability (or successful application)
of the a priori concept(s) in question to the objects of experience.
Below we'll concern ourselves with Kant's answer to Hume regarding the
objective legitimacy of the concept *cause*.

## Experience & Cognition {#experience-and-cognition}

Kant is concerned with how we might explain and justify the application
of a priori concepts to objects of experience. But this question, as it
stands, requires still sharper focus. We've seen what Kant means in his
question concerning the *legitimacy* of concepts in their application to
the objects of experience. But what does Kant mean by "*experience*"
\[*Erfahrung*\]? Our problem is that the notion of "experience," both in
German and in English, is ambiguous and can mean any number of a variety
of things---anything from the mere occurrence of sensation all the way
to empirical judgment.[^fn:1]

For Kant, "experience" is a technical term that is closely related to
*empirical cognition* \[*empirische Erkenntniss*\]. He makes this clear
at several points, both in the Deduction and elsewhere in the first
*Critique*. However, in what exactly the relation between the two
notions consists is somewhat problematic. For example, Kant says that

> Such cognitions \[i.e. those that are independent of any sense
> impression\] are called *a priori* cognitions; they are distinguished
> from empirical cognitions, *whose sources are a posteriori, namely, in
> experience* \[*Erfahrung*\] (Introduction, B2; my emphasis).

Here we see Kant saying that the *source* of empirical cognition is
experience. However, Kant also quite explicitly *identifies* empirical
cognition with experience (or treats the terms synonymously).

> Empirical cognition, however, is experience (B166).
>
> Experience is an empirical cognition, i.e., a cognition that
> determines an object through perceptions (A176/B218).
>
> Therefore experience itself---i.e., empirical cognition of
> appearances---is possible only inasmuch as we subject the succession
> of appearances, and hence all change, to the law of causality
> (A189/B234).
>
> it \[the presentation "I am"\] is not yet a cognition of that subject,
> and hence is also no empirical cognition -- i.e., experience -- of it
> (B277).

These passages all identify experience with empirical cognition. But if
they are synonymous notions then how could experience be the *source* of
empirical cognition, as is said in B2? A relatively simple resolution of
this problem is to distinguish two notions of "experience"---between
"experience" as the sensory result of affection by external objects (via
outer sense) and oneself (via inner sense) and "experience" as the
result of structuring sense perceptions via the categories. Call the
latter, categorically structured state, "complex experience" (or
"C-experience") and the former state "simple experience" (or
S-experience). We can then read B2 as saying that empirical cognition,
which is identical with C-experience, has its source in S-experience,
the material (sensation, intuition, perception) out of which complex
experience is constructed.

This also helps us make sense of B1, where Kant says,

> There is no doubt whatever that all our cognition begins with
> experience; for how else should the cognitive faculty be awakened into
> exercise if not through objects that stimulate our senses and in part
> themselves produce representations, in part bring the activity of our
> understanding into motion to compare these, to connect or separate
> them, and thus to work up the raw material of sensible impressions
> into *a cognition of objects that is called experience*? (my emphasis)

All cognition begins with *simple* experience, which is "worked up" into
cognition of objects (i.e. empirical cognition) or (as I've called it)
complex experience.

In §17 of the B-deduction Kant specifies that a cognition consists in
the "determinate relation of given representations to an object" (B137).
I take this to mean that S-experience---the contents of a sensory
intuition---provides consciousness of 'appearances' \[*Erscheinungen*\]
or 'undetermined objects' \[*unbestimmte Gegestande*\] (A20/B34)---which
is then made 'determinate' via the activity of the intellect. The result
is *empirical* cognition of an object. And it is this empirical
cognition of objects (and ultimately all cognition of objects
whatsoever) that it is the aim of Kant's Deduction to legitimate, for it
is this cognition that depends on the categories.

> all empirical cognition of objects necessarily conforms to such
> concepts \[i.e. the categories\], because nothing is possible as
> object of experience unless these concepts are presupposed A93/B126).

Hence, to show that the categories are "objectively valid" or legitimate
in their application to any and all objects of possible experience, is
for Kant to show that the categories are necessary for empirical
cognition of objects, or complex experience. One thing to think about as
we move through the argument of the Deduction is whether Kant's
conception of C-experience corresponds to anything in the positions of
empiricists like Locke and Hume. Do empiricists need to concede the
existence of the kind of experience for which Kant thinks the categories
are necessary?[^fn:2]

Kant's demonstration of the validity of the categories attempts to wind
its way between two poles which he terms the *enthusiasm* of Locke and
the *skepticism* of Hume (A94/B127). Locke's enthusiasm lay in the
attempted derivation of all our concepts from the structure of
appearances (whether we interpret these appearances as objects or merely
as ideas). But this derivation is, according to Kant, inconsistent with
the conditions for the manifestation of appearances and led us to
improperly apply our concepts beyond their sphere.

In contrast to Locke, Hume denies that the a priori concepts have any
application whatsoever, and thus Hume presents a sort of skeptical
alternative to Locke. Kant's third way argues that the structure of
C-experience and the structure of our concepts are interconnected. His
strategy for showing this is to show that the structure of C-experience
and the structure of propositional judgment have a common root---viz.
the unifying activity of the understanding. The Transcendental Deduction
is thus an attempt "to try to find out whether we cannot provide for
human reason safe passage between these two cliffs, assign to it
determinate bounds, and yet keep open for it the entire realm of its
appropriate activity" (A95/B128). How exactly Kant does this requires
explication of the first step of the Deduction, to which we'll now turn.

## Structure of the Deduction

I take the structure of the deduction to consist of two steps; the first
starts at §15 and concludes with §20 (§21 being essentially a recap of
the preceding argument). The second step begins with §22 and concludes
with §26 (with §27 also being a recapitulation). This "two-step"
interpretation is not new, though interpretation of the content of each
step and their relations to one another differs widely.[^fn:3]

The first step of the Deduction (§§15-21) argues that *combination* of
representations cannot be given to the subject via the senses, but is
rather something that the subject does. In order that the combination of
representations result in cognition, Kant then argues that there must be
a unitary subject, or *combiner* of those representations. The unity
condition is satisfied by what Kant calls, §16, the "original synthetic
unity of apperception." In the next three sections (§§17-19) Kant argues
that this unity of apperception requires a kind of activity, and that
this activity is fundamentally that of the functions of the
understanding or the "categories." He concludes in §20 that (i) since
all complex unities require combination; (ii) combination requires the
original synthetic unity of apperception; and (iii) the unity of
apperception is or essentially requires a kind of categorial activity;
that (iv) all (complex) unity, including intuition, depends on, or
"stands under" (B143) the categories.

The second step of the Deduction (§§22-7) discusses both positive and
negative points raised by the first step. Negatively, Kant argues that
the categories are limited to *empirical cognition* -- i.e. to the
cognition of appearances, not things in themselves. This importantly
includes even our cognition of *ourselves* as subjects of consciousness.
Positively, Kant argues in §26 that not only does all cognition rest on
the application of the categories, but that one and all, appearances
*are necessarily* categorial. He does this be showing that (i) we have a
priori cognition of space and time themselves as objects, (ii) that this
is only possible via the categories, (iii) and that since all
appearances are governed by space and time, any appearance in space and
time must also be categorially structured. This means that there is no
possibility of an object's appearing (i.e. being "given) that is not
susceptible to determination by the categories. If this argument is
successful then Kant will have demonstrated both that if we have
cognition ("experience" in Kant's technical sense) then it depends on
the categories, and that we *do* have such cognition, since mathematical
cognition preuspposes that we cognize space and time as objects.
