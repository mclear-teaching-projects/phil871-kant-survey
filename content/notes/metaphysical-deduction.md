Sections 9-12 of the first chapter of the Analytic of Concepts form what is
typically called the &ldquo;Metaphysical Deduction&rdquo;---a name which Kant applies only
later in the _Critique_ (see B159). The purpose of this section is to argue
that of the a priori concepts we have available to us some are more
fundamental than others. These are the concepts Kant calls the &ldquo;categories.&rdquo;
Thus, the basic question that Kant seeks to answer is the question of _which_ a
priori concepts serve as the fundamental concepts of metaphysical theorizing.
The MD provides what Kant calls a &ldquo;clue&rdquo; (or more literally a &ldquo;_Leitfaden_&rdquo; or
&ldquo;guiding thread&rdquo;) to the discovery of these concepts. The MD has three
sections. These consist of (i) an introduction where the notion of a &ldquo;logical
use&rdquo; of the faculty of concepts or the &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; is set out; (ii) an
elaboration of the different logical forms of judgment and a corresponding
table of those forms; (iii) an explication of the categories as a priori
concepts that correspond to the various logical forms of the table as set out
in (ii).

Kant&rsquo;s strategy in the ME is to argue that the categories are the most
fundamental concepts in our thought of objects because they are the concepts
that are directly linked to the various basic operations of which the
understanding (the faculty of concepts) is capable. Such operations are all
forms of &ldquo;judgment&rdquo;, and Kant construes such forms as providing the basis for
determining the categories. In order that we properly appreciate why Kant
chooses this strategy for butressing his choice of categories it helps to look
at a prior attempt Kant makes for determining the basic concepts of
metaphysics.


## The Pre-Critical Strategy {#the-pre-critical-strategy}

In Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inaugural Dissertation&rdquo; of 1770 (whose formal title is &ldquo;On the
Forms and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World&rdquo;) he lays out a
theory of the manner in which the structure of the rational human mind
determines what it can know of reality. In many ways this work anticipates
positions and arguments Kant provides in the _Critique of Pure Reason_. And like
that latter work, in the ID Kant seeks to delimit the fundamental concepts of
metaphysics (though he does not in the ID call them categories) via an
analysis of the faculty of understanding (or &ldquo;intellect&rdquo; more broadly). He
says,

> the concepts met with in metaphysics are not to be sought in the
> senses but in the very nature of the pure understanding, and that not
> as innate concepts but as concepts abstracted from the laws inherent
> in the mind (by attending to its actions on the occasion of an
> experience), and therefore as acquired concepts. (ID §8, 2:395; see
> also ID Corollary, 2:406 and ID §23, 2:411)

Here Kant articulates (or perhaps &ldquo;gestures at&rdquo; is more accurate) his view of
how the concepts of metaphysics, through which we think of the intelligible
world, are acquired. They are acquired by attending to the actions of the mind
in course of its having experience. Here it is important for Kant&rsquo;s project in
the _Dissertation_, as it will be for his project in the _Critique of Pure
Reason_, that his account of the acquisition of the concepts of metaphysics not
run afoul of his characterization of those concepts as &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; rather
than &ldquo;empirical&rdquo; or &ldquo;sensitive.&rdquo;[^fn:1] For this reason they cannot be
concepts abstracted from sensible intuition, in the manner that our concepts
of space and time are. If they _were_ abstracted from experience such concepts
would be (merely) empirical or &ldquo;sensitive on account of their genesis&rdquo; (ID §5,
2:393). Instead, the concepts of metaphysics are supposed to be &ldquo;given in a
fundamental fashion by the pure understanding itself&rdquo; (ID §23, 2:411). There
is, however, some question as to whether, in the _Dissertation_ or even in
lectures immediately subsequent to its publication, Kant in fact succeeds in
providing an account of the acquisition of the fundamental concepts of
metaphysics consistent with his stricture on their intellectual provenance.

The account of the _Dissertation_ requires that Kant provide some story as to
how we can come to be aware of the mind and its acts, and on what basis this
awareness constitutes the acquisition of a non-sensory concept. At this point
in his career, Kant has not yet articulated his doctrine of &ldquo;pure&rdquo;
apperception as distinct from inner sense (more on this in the next set of
notes). So it looks as if, given his distinction between intuition and concept
and their related faculties, that it must be an _inner intuition_ that accounts
for the acquisition of the concepts of metaphysics. However, if it _is_ inner
intuition that is the basis for such acquisition, it looks like Kant will run
afoul of his requirement that the concepts of metaphysics be intellectual as
opposed to empirical (for even the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; concepts of space and time, though
free of sensation, are nevertheless sensitive on account of being derived from
intuition (see, e.g., ID §5, 2:393)).

Perhaps Kant thinks we have a special _intellectual_ intuition of the mind and
its acts? One recent commentator [@dyck2016] has argued that Kant is committed
in the _Dissertation_ to our having intellectual intuitions of our own minds and
that he only subsequently, in the later 70s, rejects this position in favor of
one according to which it is inner _sense_---and thus empirical
psychology---that provides the requisite basis for acquiring metaphysical
concepts. Dyck&rsquo;s argument concerning Kant&rsquo;s position in the _Dissertation_
hinges on two claims. First, that there are clear texts showing that Kant
denies that sensible laws (i.e. of time and space) apply to immaterial
substances, including the mind/soul [see @dyck2016, 330]. Second, that Kant&rsquo;s
conception of the acquisition of the pure concepts of metaphysics depends on
the existence of intellectual intuition of the mind or soul itself
[see @dyck2016, 330-1]. However, neither of these interpretive points are
particularly compelling. Against the first, it is relatively clear from the
context of Kant&rsquo;s statements regarding immaterial substance that he denies
that the principles of the _corporeal_ world apply to such substances (ID §27,
2:414). That would mean that principles belonging to substances understood as
_bodies_ do not apply to the mind. But this is compatible with the conception of
the mind as nevertheless governed by other sensible principles, and in
particular, by time. Against Dyck&rsquo;s second point, in the _Dissertation_ Kant
explicitly states that finite beings lack intellectual intuition (ID §10,
2:396-7) and that &ldquo;the accidents which are not included in the relations of
space, such as the thoughts of the mind&rdquo; are in time (ID Corollary, 2:406). It
thus seems unlikely that Kant holds in the _Dissertation_ that metaphysical
concepts are acquired via intellectual intuition, on pain of explicitly
contradicting himself at multiple points.[^fn:2]

But even if Kant does not directly contradict himself in the _Dissertation_,
Dyck&rsquo;s discussion helps point us to a clear tension and perhaps fatal
ambiguity in Kant&rsquo;s pre-critical view. One might, therefore, have hope that
Kant&rsquo;s remarks in lectures and notes subsequent to the publication of the
_Dissertation_ clarify his position. However, the lecture texts we have from the
1770s only make matters more complicated. For example, in lectures shortly
after the _Dissertation_ Kant says, &ldquo;We have no intuition in the whole world
except the intuition of our self; all other things are appearances&rdquo;
(_Anthropologie Collins_ 25:15 (1772-3)). Kant&rsquo;s point here is _not_ that we have
only one intuition---viz. of ourselves. Rather, it is that all of our _outer_
intuitions are of appearances, while our inner (and non-intellectual!)
intuitions present ourselves as _substantial subjects_. In a reflexion also from
the early-to-mid 1770s Kant says that &ldquo;The I is the intuition of a substance&rdquo;
(R4493, 17:571 (1772-5)). In the _Metaphysics L<sub>1</sub>_ lectures, from roughly the
same period, Kant contrasts consciousness of external objects with
consciousness of the self. One intuits oneself immediately, but the same is
not true of external objects (28:206-7, 224). The self (as intelligence) so
intuited is substantial, simple, and immaterial (28:224-5).

In a note (R4674) from the _Duisberg Nachlass_ of 1775-6, Kant writes that an
(external) object may be represented only &ldquo;according to its relations&rdquo;, i.e.,
only according to the properties, and relations between those properties, that
are presented in sense experience.[^fn:3] And, as he does in the
lecture material cited above, Kant _contrasts_ our position with respect to
intuition of external objects with the special access we have to ourselves.
The inner intuition of oneself is of an object whose properties are not
presented, as outer things are, merely in terms of relations.[^fn:4]
The language Kant uses in R4674 is also echoed in other texts from the
mid-70s, For example, Kant states that the &rsquo;I&rsquo; is the &ldquo;original concept&rdquo; of
substance which we &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; for use in our conception of other substances
(_Metaphysics L<sub>1</sub>_, 28:225-6). Relatedly, he remarks that &ldquo;the I expresses the
substantial; for that substrate in which all accidents inhere is the
substantial. This is the only case where we can immediately intuit the
substance&rdquo; (_Pölitz Metaphysik_ 28:226 (1777-80)).

The view that emerges from these texts, and that may in fact already be
present in Kant&rsquo;s _Dissertation_, is one according to which inner sense provides
a privileged epistemic relation to oneself. In inner sense one is presented
not merely as a set of relations, as in outer sense, but as a _subject_ of
properties, as what Kant sometimes describes as an intelligence or &ldquo;thinking
substance&rdquo; (e.g. _Metaphysics L<sub>1</sub>_ 28:224-5). The self is thus the &ldquo;original
of all objects&rdquo; in the sense that, as Allison Laywine puts it, &ldquo;we somehow
transfer our representations of the one true subject and apply it derivatively
or by analogy to our thought of anything else.&rdquo;[^fn:5]

Unfortunately, Kant never clarifies how this position concerning the
privileged and peculiar role of inner sense is consistent with his general
doctrine of sensible intuition, or how it is consistent with the
_Dissertation&rsquo;s_ position that no pure intellectual concept can be derived from
the content of sensible intuition. The overall impression of Kant&rsquo;s position
based on his remarks in the Dissertation, and subsequently in the lectures, is
that of a steadfast commitment to roughly the following position.
Introspection provides a form of intuitive acquaintance with the self as a
metaphysical subject, and it is via this acquaintance that we can then form by
analogy the representations of objects (construed as metaphysical subjects of
properties) distinct from us. But how this position is ultimately supposed to
cohere with Kant&rsquo;s other commitments in the 70s is, at best, unclear. It in
facts seems a reasonable suspicion that Kant&rsquo;s various commitments in the 70s
_don&rsquo;t_ cohere, and that this resulting tension in his view is part of what
pushes him towards the critical distinction between inner intuition and pure
apperception. We&rsquo;ll talk about this distinction further when we discuss the
argument of the Transcendental Deduction. In the next section I talk about
Kant&rsquo;s revision of his _Dissertation_ strategy in the _Critique_ for the argument
of the MD.


## The Critical Strategy {#the-critical-strategy}

In the _Dissertation_ Kant distinguishes between what he terms the &ldquo;logical&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;real&rdquo; uses of the understanding (ID §23, 2:410–11). He says,

> in pure philosophy, such as metaphysics, the use of the understanding in
> dealing with principles is real; that is to say, the fundamental concepts of
> things and of relations, and the axioms themselves, are given in a fundamental
> fashion by the pure understanding itself; and, since they are not intuitions,
> they are not immune to error.

In the first _Critique_ Kant maintains the view that the concepts of metaphysics
come from the understanding. However, he significantly alters the method by
which these concepts are derived. Specifically he now closely links the
categories with the logical forms of judgment. The latter are not just a
&ldquo;clue&rdquo; to the organization of the table of categories, they _are_ the
categories, at least in their &ldquo;logical&rdquo; use. The central texts making this
plain are as follows.

> The same understanding, therefore, and indeed by means of the very same
> actions through which it brings the logical form of a judgment into
> concepts...also brings a transcendental content into its representations by
> means of the synthetic unity of the manifold in intuition in general...(MD
> §10, B105)
>
> [The categories] are concepts of an object in general, by means of
> which its intuition is regarded as determined with regard to one of
> the logical functions for judgments. (TD Transition, B128)
>
> That action of the understanding...through which the manifold of given
> representations (whether they be intuitions or concepts) is brought
> under an apperception in general, is the logical function of
> judgments. ... But now the categories are nothing other than these
> very functions for judging, insofar as the manifold of a given
> intuition is determined with regard to them (TD §20, B143)
>
> In the metaphysical deduction the origin of the a priori categories in
> general was established through their complete coincidence [_völlige
> Zusammentreffung_] with the universal logical functions of thinking
> (TD §26, B159)
>
> the pure concepts of the understanding are, of themselves, nothing but
> logical functions, but that as such they do not constitute the least
> concept of an object in itself but rather need sensory intuition as a
> basis, and even then they serve only to determine empirical judgments
> (Pr §39, 4:324)

These texts communicate two important points. First, they indicate Kant&rsquo;s
pursuit of a strategy for explaining how the pure categories, or fundamental
concepts of metaphysics, arise from the intellect. This strategy avoids
commitment to any form of content nativism, and it avoids the problem that we
saw plagued Kant&rsquo;s account in the _Dissertation_---viz. explaining how the pure
categories are &ldquo;pure&rdquo; in the sense of being traceable only to the intellect,
without thereby implicating either intellectual intuition, which he denies, or
sensible (inner) intuition, which would undermine their claim to purity.

Pursuit of this strategy means that, second, the very logical functions for
combining representations (concepts) in judgment, and which constitute the
basis of study in what Kant calls &ldquo;pure general logic&rdquo;, are also the functions
for combining representations (intuitions) in our experience of objects. Thus
for the understanding as a faculty of judging (A69/B94), each logical function
of thinking (e.g. categorical judgment), when applied to a multiplicity of
intuitions, results in a distinctive way of relating to, or &ldquo;experiencing&rdquo; in
Kant&rsquo;s technical sense, an object e.g. a substance.

Thus, Kant has a much more coherent strategy than he did in the _Dissertation_
for explaining how we come to grasp the a priori concepts necessary for doing
metaphysics. The notion that we can analyze our logic and determine which are
the basic logical forms is plausible and does not require appealing to some
privileged access we might have to ourselves in introspection (i.e. inner
sense).

However, for this strategy to ultimately succeed, Kant must provide
substantial arguments for several controversial claims. First, he must show
that he has successfully given a complete analysis of the logical forms of
judgment; second, he must show that the metaphysical concepts derived from
these logical forms (i.e. the categories) really provide the complete basis
for doing metaphysics; third, he must show that the content of the categories
does not include material absent from the purely logical forms---if there
were such &ldquo;extra&rdquo; content in the categories, then it is not clear how they are
supposed to be &ldquo;identical&rdquo; with the logical forms, as Kant sometimes indicates
that they are.

Unfortunately Kant fails to meet any of these requirements in the MD. There is
no formal demonstration of the completeness of either the table of judgment
or, correspondingly, the categories. There is likewise no demonstration
provided that shows that all and only these categories provide the basic
materials for metaphysics. Finally, it is not obvious that the content of the
categories is simply &ldquo;identical&rdquo; with that of the forms of judgment.

To take just one example, Kant construes the category of substance as related
to the form of categorical (i.e. subject/predicate) judgment. The purely
logical or grammatical notion is thus of a term or concept that can only
occupy subject position and never predicate position. However, this notion
does not adequately capture central ways in which Kant uses the concept
<substance>. More specifically, Kant construes a substance as substanding and
subsisting. This means that (i) substance is a being in which things &ldquo;_inhere_&rdquo;
and (ii) substance does not itself inhere in anything else (in this
circumscribed sense substance is an independent being). Kant construes
inherence as a real (that is, non-logical) asymmetric dependence relation
between a subject of inherence (the substance) and its properties or modes
(i.e. the way or ways in which the subject exists). The purely logical or
grammatical conception of substance as a subject term that is never a
predicate term fails to properly capture this dependence relation, for it
fails to show how a predicate term might asymmetrically depend on a subject
term in a manner that models the metaphysical relation between substance and
mode.

In the end then, while Kant&rsquo;s strategy in the MD is a clear improvement over
his prior attempt in the _Dissertation_, it is not at all clear that he
successfully defends his claim to have provided a principled and a priori
basis for exhaustively determining which are the fundamental concepts. Kant
wants an argument that,

> has not arisen rhapsodically from a haphazard search for pure concepts, of the completeness of which one could never be certain, since one would only infer it through induction, without reﬂecting that in this way one would never see why just these and not other concepts should inhabit the pure understanding. (A81/B106-7)

Kant does not provide convincing proof of this position in the MD. Whether such a proof could be given is, perhaps, another story.[^fn:6]

[^fn:1]: What are the &ldquo;concepts of metaphysics&rdquo; for Kant? Certainly they include the concept `<God>`, as well as `<soul>` and `<world>`. These all presuppose possession of the concept `<substance>`. Presumably also on the list are other concepts one would find in, e.g., Baumgarten&rsquo;s _Metaphysica_, such as `<possibility>`, `<necessity>`, `<accident>`, and so forth.
[^fn:2]: For consideration of the problem of self-consciousness in the 1770s more broadly, as well as Kant&rsquo;s rejection of intellectual intuition, see [@klemme1996, 118-26]. As [@mohr1995, 32-6] points out, Kant does speak of an intellectual (not inner) intuition of freedom in _reflexionen_ from the early-to-mid-1770s (e.g. R4336 17:509 (1769-75)) But Kant also speaks of apperception as opposed to intuition in the mid-1770s (e.g. R4723 17:688 (1773-5); R6860 19:183 (1776?-91?)). It is clear that he is struggling to express the nature of the awareness we can have, as rational beings, of our own activity (e.g. R4220 17:462 (1769-70)).

[^fn:4]: There is also indication in the _Duisburg Nachlaß_, as there was in Kant&rsquo;s lectures, of his endorsement of the rational psychology he would later come to criticize. For example, in the _Nachlaß_ Kant says that &ldquo;I would not represent anything as outside of me and thus make appearance into experience (objectively) if the representations did not relate to something _that is parallel to my I_, through which I refer them from myself to another subject&rdquo; (R4675, 17:648 (1775); my emphasis).
