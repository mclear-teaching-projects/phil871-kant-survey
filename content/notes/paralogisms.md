Kant discusses the nature and limits of our self-knowledge most
extensively in the first *Critique*, in a section of the [Transcendental
Dialectic](http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantmeta/#H6) called the "[Paralogisms
of Pure Reason](http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantview/#SSH2gi)". Here Kant is
concerned to criticize the claims of what he calls "rational
psychology", and specifically, the claim that we can have substantive
metaphysical knowledge of the nature of the subject, based purely on an
analysis of the concept of the thinking self, or as Kant typically puts
it, the `<I think>`.

> **I think** is thus the sole text of rational psychology, from which
> it is to develop its entire wisdom...because the least empirical
> predicate would corrupt the rational purity and independence of the
> science from all experience. (A343/B401)

There are four "Paralogisms". Each argument is presented as a
[syllogism](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/#H9), which consists of two
premises and a conclusion. According to Kant, each argument is guilty of
an equivocation on a term common to the premises, such that the argument
is invalid. Kant's aim, in his discussion of each Paralogism, is to
diagnose the equivocation, and explain why the rational psychologist's
argument ultimately fails. In so doing Kant provides a great deal of
information about his own views concerning the mind (See Ameriks (2000)
for extensive discussion). The argument of the first Paralogism concerns
our knowledge of the self as substance; the second, the simplicity of
the self; the third, the numerical identity of the self; the fourth,
knowledge of the self versus knowledge of things in space. We'll take
these arguments in turn.

## Substantiality (A348-51/B410-11) {#substantiality--a348-51-b410-11}

Kant presents the rationalist's argument in the First Paralogism as
follows:

1.  What cannot be thought otherwise than as subject does not exist
    otherwise than as subject, and is therefore substance.
2.  Now a thinking being, considered merely as such, cannot be thought
    otherwise than as subject.
3.  ∴ A thinking being also exists only as such a thing, i.e., as
    substance.

Kant's presentation of the argument is rather compressed. In more
explicit form we can put it as follows (see Proops (2010) and Rosefeldt
(2017)):

1.  All entities that cannot be thought otherwise than as subjects are
    entities that cannot exist otherwise than as subjects, and therefore
    (by definition) are substances. (All M are P)
2.  All entities that are thinking beings (considered merely as such)
    are entities that cannot be thought otherwise than as subjects. (All
    S are M)
3.  ∴ All entities that are thinking beings (considered merely as such)
    are entities that cannot exist otherwise than as subjects, and
    therefore are substances (All S are P)

The relevant equivocation concerns the term that occupies the 'M' place
in the argument -- viz. "entities that cannot be thought otherwise than
as subjects". Kant specifically locates the ambiguity in the use of the
term "thought" \[*Das Denken*\], which he claims is taken in the first
premise to concern an object in general, and thus something that could
be given in a possible intuition. In the second premise the use of
"thought" is supposed to apply only to a feature of thought and, thus,
not to an object of a possible intuition (B411-12).

> The major premise talks about a being that can be thought of in every
> respect, and consequently also as it might be given in intuition. But
> the minor premise talks about this being only insofar as it considers
> itself as a subject relatively only to thinking and the unity of
> consciousness, but not at the same time in relation to intuition,
> through which it is given as an object for thinking. Hence the
> conclusion is inferred *per sophisma figurae dictionis*, and hence
> through a fallacy. (B411)

The representation 'I' has the formal feature of
non-predicability---there is no possible thought that features it as a
predicate. But this fact is not sufficient for showing that the referent
of `<I>` is a subsisting and substanding being. Why not? Because `<I>`
can never be applied to such a being on the basis of a sensible
intiuition, which could only present the subject as it appears and not
as it is in itself. In particular, our sensible intuition in inner sense
can present nothing that persists, so it cannot present a persisting
soul or absolute subject either (eg. A350).

Hence, against the rational psychologist, Kant argues that we cannot
make any legitimate inference from the conditions under which the
representation `<I>` may be thought, or employed in a judgment, to the
status of the 'I' as a metaphysical subject of properties. Kant makes
this point explicit when he says,

> the first syllogism of transcendental psychology imposes on us an only
> allegedly new insight when it passes off the constant logical subject
> of thinking as the cognition of a real subject of inherence, with
> which we do not and cannot have the least acquaintance, because
> consciousness is the one single thing that makes all representations
> into thoughts, and in which, therefore, as in the transcendental
> subject, our perceptions must be encountered; and apart from this
> logical significance of the I, we have no acquaintance with the
> subject in itself that grounds this I as a substratum, just as it
> grounds all thoughts. (A350)

Since, Kant denies that we have any intuition, empirical or otherwise,
of ourselves as subjects, we cannot, merely in reflection on the
conditions of thinking of ourselves using the first-person concept, come
to have any knowledge concerning what we are. No amount of introspection
or reflection on the content of the first-person concept `<I>` will
yield such knowledge.

## Simplicity (A351-61/B407-8) {#simplicity--a351-61-b407-8}

Kant's discussion of the proposed metaphysical simplicity of the subject
largely depends on points he made in the previous Paralogism concerning
its proposed substantiality. Kant articulate the Second Paralogism as
follows:

1.  The subject whose action can never be regarded as the concurrence of
    many acting things, is simple. (All A is B)
2.  The self is such a subject. (C is A)
3.  ∴ The self is simple. (C is B)

Here the equivocation concerns the notion of a "subject". Kant's point,
as with the previous Paralogism, is that, from the fact that one's
first-person representation of the self is always a grammatical or
logical subject, nothing follows concerning the metaphysical status of
the referent of that representation.

Of perhaps greater interest in this discussion of the Paralogism of
simplicity is Kant's analysis of what he calls (in the A-edition) the
"Achilles of all dialectical inferences" (A351). According to the
Achilles argument, the soul or mind is known to be a simple unitary
substance because only such a substance could think unitary thoughts.
Call this the "unity claim" (see Brook (1997)):

(UC):
:   if a multiplicity of representations are to form a single
    representation, they must be contained in the absolute unity of the
    thinking substance. (A352)

Against UC, Kant argues that we have no reason to think that the
structure of a thought, as a complex of representations, isn't mirrored
in the complex structure of an entity which thinks the thought. UC is
not analytic, which is to say that there is no contradiction entailed by
its negation. UC also fails to be a synthetic a priori claim, since it
follows neither from the nature of the forms of intuition, nor from the
categories. Hence UC could only be shown to be true empirically, and
since we do not have any empirical intuition of the self, we have no
basis for thinking that UC must be true (A353).

Kant here makes a point familiar from contemporary
[functionalist](http://www.iep.utm.edu/functism/) accounts of the mind
(see Meerbote (1991); Brook (1997)). Our mental functions, including the
unity of conscious thought, are consistent with a variety of different
possible media in which the functions are realized. Kant's point is that
there is no contradiction in thinking that a plurality of substances
might succeed in generating a single unified thought. Hence we cannot
know that the mind is such that it must be simple in nature.

## Numerical Identity (A361-66/B408) {#numerical-identity--a361-66-b408}

Kant articulates the Third Paralogism as follows:

1.  What is conscious of the numerical identity of its Self in different
    times, is to that extent a person. (All C is P)
2.  Now the soul is conscious of the numerical identity of its Self in
    different times. (S is C)
3.  ∴ The soul is a person. (S is P)

The interest taken in establishing the personality of the soul or mind
by the rational psychologists, stems from the importance of proving that
not only would the mind persist after the destruction of its body, but
also that this mind would be the same person, and not just some sort of
bare consciousness or worse (e.g. existing only as a "[bare
monad](http://www.iep.utm.edu/lei-mind/#SH1a)").

Kant here makes two main points. First, the rational psychologist cannot
infer from the sameness of the first-person representation (the "I
think"), across applications of it in judgment, to any conclusion
concerning the sameness of the metaphysical subject referred to by that
representation. Kant is thus once again making a functionalist point
that the medium in which a series of representational states inheres may
change over time, and there is no contradiction in conceiving of a
series of representations as being transferred from one substance to
another (A363-4, note).

Second, Kant argues that we can be confident of the soul's possession of
*personality* in virtue of the persistence of apperception. The relevant
notion of "personality" here is one concerning the contrast between a
rational being and an animal. While the persistence of apperception
(i.e. the persistence of the "I think" as being able to attach to all of
one's representations) does not provide an apperceiving subject with any
insight into the true metaphysical *nature* of the mind, it does provide
evidence of the soul's possession of an understanding. Animals, by
contrast, do not possess an understanding but, at best (according to
Kant), only an analogue thereof. As Kant says in the *Anthropology*,

> That man can have the I among his representations elevates him
> infinitely above all other living beings on earth. He is thereby a
> person \[...\] that is, by rank and worth a completely distinct being
> from things that are the same as reason-less animals with which one
> can do as one pleases. (An 7:127, §1)

Hence, so long as a soul possesses the capacity for apperception, it
will signal the possession of an understanding, and thus serves to
distinguish the human soul from that of an animal (see Dyck (2010),
120).

## Relation to Objects in Space (A366-80/B409) {#relation-to-objects-in-space--a366-80-b409}

Finally, the Fourth Paralogism (here I primarily discuss the A-edition
version) concerns the relation between our awareness of our own minds
and our awareness of other objects distinct from ourselves, and thus as
located in space. Kant describes the Fourth Paralogism as follows:

1.  What can be only causally inferred is never certain. (All I is
    not C)
2.  The existence outer objects can only be causally inferred, not
    immediately perceived by us. (O is I)
3.  ∴ We can never be certain of the existence of outer objects. (O is
    not C)

Kant locates the damaging ambiguity in the conception of "outer"
objects. This is puzzling since it doesn't play the relevant role as
middle term in the syllogism. But Kant is quite clear that this is where
the ambiguity lies and distinguishes between two distinct senses of the
"outer" or "external":

Trancendentally Outer/External:
:   a seperate existence, in and of itself

Empirically Outer/External:
:   an existence in space

Kant's point here is that all appearances in space are empirically
external to the subject who perceives or thinks about them, while
nevertheless being transcendentally internal, in that such spatial
appearances do not have an entirely independent metaphysical nature,
since their spatial features depend at least in part on our forms of
intuition.

Kant then uses this distinction not only to argue against the assumption
of the rational psychologist that the mind is better known than any
object in space (this a claim famously argued by
[Descartes](http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/#SH4b)), but also against
those forms of external world skepticism championed by
[Descartes](http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/#SH8a) and
[Berkeley](http://www.iep.utm.edu/berkeley/#H4). Kant identifies
Berkeley with what he calls "dogmatic idealism" and Descartes with what
he calls "problematic idealism" (A377).

Problematic Idealism:
:   we cannot be certain of the existence of any material body

Dogmatic Idealism:
:   we can be certain that no material body exists -- the notion of a
    body is self-contradictory

Kant brings two arguments to bear against the rational psychologist's
assumption about the immediacy of our self-knowledge, as well as these
two forms of skepticism, with mixed results. The two arguments are (what
I am calling) the arguments from "immediacy" and "imagination". We'll
take these in turn.

### i. The Immediacy Argument {#i-dot-the-immediacy-argument}

In an extended passage in the Fourth Paralogism (A370-1) Kant makes the
following argument:

> external objects (bodies) are merely appearances, hence also nothing
> other than a species of my representations, whose objects are
> something only through these representations, but are nothing
> separated from them. Thus external things exist as well as my self,
> and indeed both exist on the immediate testimony of my
> self-consciousness, only with this difference: the representation of
> my Self, as the thinking subject, is related merely to inner sense,
> but the representations that designate extended beings are also
> related to outer sense. I am no more necessitated to draw inferences
> in respect of the reality of external objects than I am in regard to
> the reality of the objects of my inner sense (my thoughts), for in
> both cases they are nothing but representations, the immediate
> perception (consciousness) of which is at the same time a sufficient
> proof of their reality. (A370-1)

I take the argument here to be as follows:

1.  Rational Psychology (RP) privileges awareness of the subject and its
    states over awareness of non-subjective states.
2.  But transcendental idealism entails that we are aware of both
    subjective and objective states, as they appear, *in the same way*
    -- viz. via a form of *intuition*.
3.  So either both kinds of awareness are immediate or they are both
    mediate.
4.  Since awareness of subjective states is obviously immediate then
    awareness of objective states must also be immediate.
5.  ∴ We are immediately aware of the states or properties of physical
    objects.

Here Kant displays what he takes to be an advantage of his
[Transcendental Idealism](http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantmeta/#H4). Since
both inner and outer sense depend on intuition, there is nothing special
about inner intuition that privileges it over outer intuition. Both are,
as intuitions, immediate presentations of objects (at least as they
appear). Unfortunately, Kant never makes clear what he means by the term
"immediate" \[*unmittelbar*\]. This issue is much contested (see Smit
(2000)). At the very least, he means to signal that our awareness in
intuition is not mediated by any explicit or conscious inference, as
when he says that the transcendental idealist "grants to matter, as
appearance, a reality which need not be inferred, but is immediately
perceived" (A371).

It is not obvious that an external world skeptic would find this
argument convincing, since part of the grip of such skepticism on us
relies on the (at least initially) convincing point that things could
*seem* to one just as they currently are, even if there really is no
external world causing one's experiences. This may just beg the question
against Kant (particularly premise (2) of the above argument). And
certainly Kant seems to think that his arguments for the existence of
the pure intuitions of space and time in the Transcendental Aesthetic
lend some weight to his position here. Thus Kant is not so much arguing
*for* Transcendental Idealism here as explaining some of the further
benefits that come when the position is adopted. He does, however,
present at least one further argument against the skeptical objection
articulated above -- viz. the argument from imagination, to which we'll
now turn.

### ii. The Argument from Imagination {#ii-dot-the-argument-from-imagination}

Kant's attempt to respond to the skeptical worry that things might
appear to be outside us while not actually *existing* outside us appeals
to the role that imagination would have to play to make such a
possibility plausible (A373-4; cf. *Anthropology*, 7:167-8).

> This material or real entity, however, this Something that is to be
> intuited in space, necessarily presupposes perception, and it cannot
> be invented by any power of imagination or produced independently of
> perception, which indicates the reality of something in space. Thus
> sensation is that which designates a reality in space and time,
> according to whether it is related to the one or the other mode of
> sensible intuition.

What follows is my reconstruction of this argument.

1.  If problematic idealism is correct then it is possible for one to
    have never perceived any spatial object but only to have imagined
    doing so.
2.  But imagination cannot fabricate -- it can only *re*-fabricate.
3.  So, if one has sensory experience of outer spatial objects, then one
    must have had at least one successful perception of an external
    spatial object.
4.  ∴ It is certain that an extended spatial world exists.

Kant's idea here is that the imagination is too limited to generate the
various qualities that we experience as instantiated in external
physical objects. Hence, it would not be possible to simply *imagine* an
external physical world without having been originally exposed to the
qualities instantiated in the physical world, *ergo* the physical world
must exist. Even Descartes seems to agree with this, noting in
*Meditation I* that "\[certain simple kinds of qualities\] are as it
were the real colours from which we form all the images of things,
whether true or false, that occur in our thought" (Descartes (1984),
13-14). Though Descartes goes on to doubt our capacity to know even such
basic qualities given the possible existence of an evil deceiver, it is
notable that the deceiver must be something other than ourselves, in
order to account for all the richness and variety of what we experience
(however, see *Meditation VI* (Descartes (1984), 54), where Descartes
wonders whether there could be some hidden faculty in ourselves
producing all of our ideas).

Unfortunately, it isn't clear that the argument from imagination gets
Kant a conclusion of the desired strength, for all that it shows (if it
shows anything) is that there was *at one time* a physical world, which
affected one's senses and provided the material for one's sense
experiences. This might be enough to show that one has not always been
radically deceived, but it is not enough to show that one is not
*currently* being radically deceived. Even worse, it isn't even clear
that we need a *physical* world to generate the requisite material for
the imagination. Perhaps all that is needed is *something* distinct from
the subject, which is capable of generating in it the requisite sensory
experiences, whether or not they are veridical. This conclusion is thus
compatible with that "something" being Descartes's evil demon, or in
contemporary epistemology, with the subject's being a [brain in a
vat](http://www.iep.utm.edu/brainvat/). Hence, it is not obvious that
Kant's argument succeeds in refuting the skeptic, or to the extent that
it does, that it shows that we know there is a *physical* world, as
opposed merely to the existence of something distinct from the subject.

## Lessons of the Paralogisms

Beyond the specific arguments of the Paralogisms and their conclusions,
they present us with two central tenets of Kant's conception of the
mind. First, that we cannot move from claims concerning the character or
role of the first-person representation `<I>` to claims concerning the
nature of the referent of that representation. This is a key part of his
criticism of rational psychology. Second, that we do not have privileged
access to our self as compared with things outside us. Both the self (or
its states) and external objects are on par with respect to intuition.
This also means that we only have access to ourselves as we *appear*,
and not as we fundamentally, metaphysically, *are* (cf. B157). Hence,
according to Kant, our self-awareness, just as much as our awareness of
anything distinct from ourselves, is conditioned by our sensibility. Our
intellectual access to ourselves in apperception, Kant argues, does not
reveal anything about our metaphysical nature, in the sense of the kind
of *thing* that must exist to realize the various cognitive powers that
Kant describes as characteristic of a being capable of apperception
(e.g. a spontaneous understanding or intellect).
