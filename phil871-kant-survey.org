This is the homepage for *PHIL 871* -- Kant's Critical Philosophy. 

This course provides an intensive study of the metaphysical, epistemological,
and moral doctrines of Kant's mature "critical" philosophy. Our discussion
covers three central themes of Kant's work: his conception of the nature and
limits of the rational mind; his critique of traditional metaphysics; and his
conception of morality as the expression of one's rational agency. Specific
topics covered include: the limits of human knowledge; the role of the mind in
the production of experience; the reality of space and time; the nature of
matter; reason and its ability to critique itself; knowledge of the self;
freedom of the will; the objectivity of morality; the existence of God; the
afterlife of the soul; the status of metaphysics; and the relationship between
'appearances' and 'ultimate reality'

Here are some possible topics for papers. You are welcome to write on something else (or on some modified topic related to one of the options below), but please discuss this with me first. The first draft of the paper is due *Friday, November 17th*. The final draft is due *Friday, December 8th*.  


1. What is Kant's argument for necessary causal connection in the Second Analogy? Is this argument cogent? Does it provide a plausible response to Hume?
2. What is Kant's argument for the ideality of space in the Transcendental Aesthetic? Is this argument cogent? 
3. Kant sometimes presents the categories as simply identical with the forms of judgment. Why would he say this? What problems are there for the identity view? Why might it be important for the rest of Kant's argument in the /Critique/ that they be identical? 
4. In the Third Antinomy, what possibility regarding our freedom does Kant want to secure? Why does Kant think this is important? What is his argument for our possible freedom? Is it cogent?
5. In the final section of the /Groundwork/ Kant presents an argument that we know we are transcendentally free. What is this argument? Is it cogent?

[[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/][Immanuel Kant]] (1724--1804) was the most significant German philosopher of the
eighteenth century, and was a key figure in the [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/][Enlightenment]]. He wrote most
of his most famous philosophical works relatively late in his professional
life, having only achieved a permanent position as professor in 1770, at the
age of forty-six. From 1781 to 1798 Kant published a series of tremendously
influential philosophical works, including the /Critique of Pure Reason/
(1781/​7), the /Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals/ (1785), the /Metaphysical
Foundations of Natural Science/ (1786), the /Critique of Practical Reason/
(1788), and the /Critique of the Power of Judgment/ (1790).

We'll be primarily focusing on Kant's project in the /Critique of Pure Reason/,
as well as the moral philosophy of the /Groundwork for the Metaphysics of
Morals/ and the /Critique of Practical Reason/. There are certain aspects of
Kant's project in the /Critique of Pure Reason/ that should be very familiar to
those with knowledge of prominent European philosophers of the 17th and 18th
centuries. For example, like Descartes, Locke, and Hume, Kant wishes to
articulate the nature and extent of human knowledge, and to do so in a manner
which proceeds from an analysis of the nature of human cognitive capacities.
Kant believes that human reason requires a ‘critique'---a kind of process of
self-examination or scrutiny---as to whether it is fit to provide us with
knowledge. Kant ultimately argues that human reason is not fit to provide us
with knowledge of a mind-independent reality transcending human experience. In
this sense Kant is deeply sympathetic with ‘empiricist' critiques by Locke,
Berkeley, and Hume of ‘rationalist' philosophers such as Descartes and
Leibniz.

However, Kant also argues that we have much deeper and more extensive
knowledge of the world we experience (or could possibly experience) than his
empiricist predecessors would allow. For example, Kant argues that we have
knowledge of necessary truths concerning aspects of the empirical world (such
as that every event in the empirical world has a cause), as well as truths
which are universal in scope or extent. Thus Kant articulates a view that is
directly opposed to the kinds of skeptical arguments Hume discusses in his
/Treatise/ and first /Enquiry/.

Kant thus thinks that we have knowledge of the necessary and universal laws
governing the empirical world---or more simple, "nature"---while he
nevertheless argues that we are almost wholly ignorant of the fundamental
reality which underlies or grounds the existence of the natural world. In
this way Kant combines various aspects of both the traditional rationalist and
empiricist positions. Like Locke and Hume, Kant thinks we must realize that
the boundaries of human knowledge stop at experience, and thus that we must be
extraordinarily circumspect concerning any claim made about what reality is
like independent of all human experience. But, like Descartes and Leibniz,
Kant thinks that central parts of human knowledge nevertheless exhibit
characteristics of necessity and universality, and that, contrary to Hume's
skeptical arguments, we can have good reason to think that they do.

Kant thus critiques pure reason in order to show its nature and limits, and
thereby curb the pretensions of various metaphysical systems articulated on
the basis of a firm faith that reason alone allows us to scrutinize the very
depths of reality. But Kant also argues that the legitimate domain of reason
is more extensive and more substantive than previous empiricist critiques had
allowed. In this way Kant salvages much of the prevailing Enlightenment
conception of reason as an organ for knowledge of the world.

Below I characterize some of the central aspects of Kant's epistemological
framework and how that framework significantly revolutionized our
understanding of the possible nature and extent of human knowledge.


**** The A Priori

A variety of philosophers from the Early Modern period (e.g. Descartes,
Leibniz, Hume) argue that there are kinds of knowledge that may be had just by
thinking, and that such forms of knowledge are universal and necessary in
scope. Hume's conception of knowledge made this especially clear. According to
Hume, knowledge of necessary and universal truths must be purely a function of
knowledge of the relations of ideas.

Kant agrees with Hume that a priori knowledge is independent of experience. In
fact, he sees it as definitive of 'pure' a priori knowledge that it be
completely independent of experience in the sense that its content is neither
derived from experience not justified by experience in its application. He
contrasts such knowledge with 'empirical' knowledge or knowledge a posteriori.
A priori knowledge may be more or less 'pure' according to whether or not the
concepts which make it up are themselves a priori knowable. Kant uses the
example 'every alteration has a cause' as an example of /impure/ a priori
knowledge, since the concept =<alteration>= is empirical.

One important point about Kant's use of 'independent' in describing the a
priori. Kant does not think that a priori knowledge is independent of
experience in the sense that one need not have /any/ experience in order to have
knowledge. On the contrary, Kant thinks that /all/ of our knowledge depends on
our having experience of some kind or another, though he doesn't think this
dependence entails that all our judgments are ultimately /justified/ by
experience. This is why Kant says that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  But although all our cognition commences with experience, yet it does
  not on that account all arise from experience. (CPR B1)
#+END_QUOTE

There seems to be two reasons for Kant's thinking this. First, we need
experience in order for our cognitive faculties to function and develop.
Second, we may need particular experiences in order to acquire empirical
concepts (e.g. red experiences in order to acquire the concept =<red>=). This is
what distinguishes pure from impure a priori judgments. Impure a priori
judgments are partially constituted by concepts whose content is in some way
derived from content given by the senses.

If a priori knowledge is, for Kant, knowledge that is (in some sense to
be further specified) /independent/ of experience, that fact is not the
only mark or indicator that some bit of knowledge is a priori. In
addition, Kant argues, any bit of knowledge that is necessary and/or
universal in scope is itself a priori.

#+begin_quote
  Necessity and strict universality are therefore secure indications" of
  an a priori cognition, and also belong together inseparably. But since
  in their use it is sometimes easier to show the empirical limitation
  in judgments than the contingency in them, or is often more plausible
  to show the unrestricted universality that we ascribe to a judgment
  than its necessity, it is advisable to employ separately these two
  criteria, each of which is in itself infallible. (CPR B4)
#+end_quote
  

Kant argues that this conception of a priori knowledge is presupposed in many
empirical judgments as well as in particular sciences. He specifically points
to mathematics ('5+7=12') and to physical judgments ('every alteration has a
cause'). One of Kant's arguments against Humean skepticism is that all of our
empirical knowledge (even that knowledge which we think we have
unproblematically) presupposes a priori knowledge, which itself requires that
there be legitimate use of pure a priori concepts (i.e. concepts which cannot be
derived from any sense impression).

Kant thinks that there are many examples of judgments which we claim to know a
priori, but he is interested primarily in a specific subset of those which
constitute the subject matter of /metaphysics/---viz. judgments concerning God,
the soul (or mind), and immortality. One of Kant's primary aims is to
determine whether metaphysical knowledge is possible, and if it is possible,
what the extent and nature of that knowledge might be. This is what it means
when Kant says that he wishes to set metaphysics "on the secure path of a
science" (e.g. Bxvi). Metaphysical knowledge is problematic, Kant argues,
because unlike other forms of a priori knowledge, such as logic and
mathematics, it is not at all obvious which metaphysical judgments are in fact
correct and thus known, and which are merely thought to be so. This is
exemplified, Kant thinks, by the contentious disputes in which philosophers
have long been involved. Kant provides the following memorable description of
the sad plight of metaphysics. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In metaphysics we have to retrace our path countless times, because we find
that it does not lead where we want to go, and it is so far from reaching
unanimity in the assertions of its adherents that it is rather a battlefield,
and indeed one that appears to be especially determined for testing one's
powers in mock combat; on this battlefield no combatant has ever gained the
least bit of ground, nor has any been able to base any lasting possession on
his victory. Hence there is no doubt that up to now the procedure of
metaphysics has been a mere groping, and what is the worst, a groping among
mere concepts. (Bxiv-xiv)
#+END_QUOTE 

Kant thus hopes that, by giving a critique of reason, he can demonstrate the
extent to which metaphysics might count as a science. As a secure science it
would rest on a secure set of claims and no longer be a "groping among mere
concepts."

**** The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction

A judgment is known (or knowable) a priori if it is known (or knowable)
independently of experience. Kant thinks that this is not the only dimension
according to which one can analyze a judgment. Kant also argues that all
judgments, in addition to being classifiable as either a priori or a
posteriori (or empirical), may also be classified as being either [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/][analytic or
synthetic]].

An analytic judgment is one in which the predicate is ‘contained' in the
concept. One way of understanding this notion of ‘containment' is via a claim
about meaning. Accordingly, analytic judgments are those whose truth is known
merely in virtue of knowing the meaning or content of the concepts
constituting the judgment. For example, in the judgment ‘All bachelors are
unmarried' the concept =<unmarried>= is part of the meaning of =<bachelor>= and so
the truth of the judgment is grasped just by knowing the relevant meanings or
contents of its component concepts.

Kant also introduces several other markers of analyticity. In total Kant
provides us with four different marks of analyticity. He says that in an
analytic judgment the predicate is

1. ‘contained' within the subject
2. ‘identical' with the subject
3. analytic judgments are ones which are ‘explicative' rather than
   ‘ampliative'
4. analytic judgments are those knowable by means of application of the
   principle of non-contradiction

Which, if any of these markers is best thought of as the main characteristic
of an analytic judgment? This is a disputed issue (cf. [cite:@anderson2005;
@proops2005]), though certainly, in all cases Kant is thinking of ‘atomic'
judgments of subject-predicate form.

**** The Synthetic A Priori

Kant argues, in ways similar to Locke, Hume, and Leibniz, that analytic
judgments are knowable a priori. Staying with the ‘containment' metaphor,
since the predicate is contained in the subject of an analytic judgment, there
is no need to look beyond the judgment to the world (so to speak) in order to
determine the truth value of the judgment. In this Kant is obviously in
agreement with Locke, Hume, and Leibniz. Kant agrees with his empiricist
predecessors in claiming that all a posteriori judgments are synthetic. Since
the predicate is adding something new to the subject we must look beyond the
judgment to the world---what we can experience---in order that we might
determine the relevant judgments truth or falsity. In non-empirical cases
(like the bachelor example above) the judgment's truth is determined by the
meanings of the concepts constituting it.

Kant's main innovation to the a priori/posteriori and analytic/synthetic
schemas is to note that the analytic a priori and the synthetic a posteriori
do not necessarily exhaust the realm of possible judgments. Here he
essentially can be understood to deny that "Hume's Fork" is an adequate
representation of the structure of human knowledge. According to Kant, there
are also /synthetic a priori/ judgments that are possible. Kant argues that
causal judgments are a clear example.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  it is easy to show that in human cognition there actually are such
  necessary and in the strictest sense universal, thus pure a priori
  judgments. If one wants an example from the sciences, one need only
  look at all the propositions of mathematics; if one would have one
  from the commonest use of the understanding, the proposition that
  every alteration must have a cause will do; indeed in the latter the
  very concept of a cause so obviously contains the concept of a
  necessity of connection with an effect and a strict universality of
  rule that it would be entirely lost if one sought, as Hume did, to
  derive it from a frequent association of that which happens with that
  which precedes and a habit (thus a merely subjective necessity) of
  connecting representations arising from that association (CPR B4-5)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Take the proposition: "Everything that happens has its cause." In the
  concept of something that happens, I think, to be sure, of an
  existence that was preceded by a time, etc., and from that analytic
  judgments can be drawn. But the concept of a cause lies entirely
  outside that concept, and indicates something different than the
  concept of what happens in general, and is therefore not contained in
  the latter representation at all. How then do I come to say something
  quite different about that which happens in general, and to cognize
  the concept of cause as belonging to it, indeed necessarily, even
  though not contained in it? What is the unknown=X here on which the
  understanding depends when it believes itself to discover beyond the
  concept of A a predicate that is foreign to it yet which it
  nevertheless believes to be connected with it? (CPR B13-14)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant argues here that our judgments concerning events presuppose that they do
not just /occur/ but are /caused to occur/, that we know this to be true
necessarily and universally, and that we have no explanation of this fact
unless the judgments we make in such cases are synthetic a priori judgments.
The question remains, however, just how such synthetic a priori judgments
could be possibly true, much less known to be so. What is it that could link
the concepts in a subject-predicate judgment such that the truth of the
judgment holds necessarily and universally, while its nevertheless being true
that the predicate is not contained in the subject of the judgment, and thus
that the judgment is not analytic?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Now the entire final aim of our speculative a priori cognition rests
  on such synthetic, i.e., ampliative principles; for the analytic ones
  are, to be sure, most important and necessary, but only for
  attaining that distinctness of concepts which is requisite for a
  secure and extended synthesis as a really new acquisition (CPR B13-14)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant argues that we need to explain how synthetic a priori judgments are
possible, and that the explanation of the possibility of significant portions
of our knowledge rests on this, including mathematics and natural science, as
well as the very possibility of metaphysics.

**** Mathematics and the Synthetic A Priori

Recall that for Hume, mathematical knowledge was a function merely of
knowledge of relations of ideas, in other words, that math is analytic
and a priori. Kant disputes this. Our mathematical knowledge is
certainly a priori, he thinks, but it is not explained in terms of
relations of ideas or concepts (i.e. in terms of containment or any of
the other marks of analyticity). Instead, Kant argues that mathematical
knowledge must be /synthetic/, but since it is necessary and universal,
also /a priori/. Here's how Kant puts the point in his /Prolegomena/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The essential feature of pure mathematical cognition, differentiating
  it from all other a priori cognition, is that it must throughout
  proceed not from concepts, but always and only through the
  construction of concepts (Critique, p. 713). Because pure mathematical
  cognition, in its propositions, must therefore go beyond the concept
  to that which is contained in the intuition corresponding to it, its
  propositions can and must never arise through the analysis of
  concepts, i.e., analytically, and so are one and all synthetic.
  (/Prolegomena/ 4:272, p. 20)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant uses two examples in his argument concerning mathematics. The first
is the judgment '7+5=12' and the second is the geometric judgment that
'the shortest distance between two points is a straight line'. Though
both judgments are knowable a priori, Kant thinks that in neither of
these two cases can we explain the truth of the judgments analytically.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  One might well at first think: that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is a
  purely analytic proposition that follows from the concept of a sum of
  seven and five according to the principle of contradiction. However,
  upon closer inspection, one finds that the concept of the sum of 7 and
  5 contains nothing further than the unification of the two numbers
  into one, through which by no means is thought what this single number
  may be that combines the two. The concept of twelve is in no way
  already thought because I merely think to myself this unification of
  seven and five, and I may analyze my concept of such a possible sum
  for as long as may be, still I will not meet with twelve therein.
  (/Prolegomena/ 4:268-9, p. 18)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's argument here is that while it might be analytically true that
the sum of 7 and 5 is /a number/ (and also that it must be a /natural
number/), it is not clear from analysis alone that the sum is equal to
12, or any other pair of natural numbers which might sum to 12.

Kant seems to think that to the extent one finds the answer twelve
/obvious/ one is adverting, either explicitly or implicitly, to some
particular experience of adding units, such as counting on one's
fingers, or adding up objects (e.g. apples, chairs, blocks, etc.).

Also, if '7+5=12' is known analytically, then in thinking it one is
equivalently thinking of any or all the numbers which are equal to 12,
including /very large/ numbers (e.g. any numbers /m/ and /n/ which might yield 12).
This certainly doesn't reflect our experience when calculating such sums,
which may yield further evidence that the judgment isn't analytically true.[fn:44]

**** The Copernican Turn

In a famous passage in the second edition of the /Critique of Pure Reason/ Kant
makes an analogy between the strategy pursued by his critical philosophy and
the central contribution of Nicolas Copernicus.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Up to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must conform to
  the objects; but all attempts to find out something about them a
  priori through concepts that would extend our cognition have, on this
  presupposition, come to nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do
  not get farther with the problems of metaphysics by assuming that the
  objects must conform to our cognition, which would agree better with
  the requested possibility of an a priori cognition of them, which is
  to establish something about objects before they are given to us. This
  would be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus, who, when he did
  not make good progress in the explanation of the celestial motions if
  he assumed that the entire celestial host revolves around the
  observer, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made
  the observer revolve and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we
  can try in a similar way regarding the intuition of objects. (CPR
  Preface, Bxvi-xvii)
#+END_QUOTE

So just as Copernicus sought to explain the apparent motions of objects
in the heavens in terms of the movement of the earthbound observer, so
too Kant attempts to account for the apparent characteristics of objects
in terms of our cognitive faculties and the cognitive conditions under
which we know the objective world. In Kantian phrase, instead of
assuming that our knowledge of the object must conform to /it/, we
assume that it conforms to /our knowledge/.

**** Transcendental Idealism

Kant's name for the position he articulates according to which objects
must conform to our way of knowing them is ‘Transcendental Idealism.'
Though the exact meaning of Transcendental Idealism is much disputed by
Kant's interpreters, it is clear that he intends at least two things by
it.

First, according to Transcendental Idealism, space and time are neither
independent subsisting entities (as was suggested by Newton), nor
object-dependent orders of relations between entities (as was argued by
Leibniz). Instead, they are mind-dependent 'forms of intuition.' They are thus
understood in terms of the characteristic ways in which we experience things
rather than either being mind-independent things that we experience, or
relations between mind-independent things that we experience. Kant argues that
space and time are nevertheless 'empirically real' --- they are fundamental
features of the empirical world that we experience. But they are not real ‘in
themselves.' They have no ultimate reality apart from our capacity for
experience.

Second, in addition to the transcendental ideality of space and time, to
which all experienced objects must conform, Kant argues that empirical
reality is itself further structured by a privileged set of a priori concepts.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  experience itself is a kind of cognition requiring the understanding,
  whose rule I have to presuppose in myself before any object is given
  to me, hence a priori, which rule is expressed in concepts a priori,
  to which all objects of experience must therefore necessarily conform,
  and with which they must agree. As for objects insofar as they are
  thought merely through reason, and necessarily at that, but that (at
  least as reason thinks them) cannot be given in experience at all -
  the attempt to think them (for they must be capable of being thought)
  will provide a splendid touchstone of what we assume as the altered
  method of our way of thinking, namely that we can cognize of things a
  priori only what we ourselves have put into them (CPR Preface,
  Bxvii-xviii)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant here argues that the object which appear to one in perceptual
experience, or ‘intuition' as he calls it, also must conform to our
basic conceptual scheme. He explains what he means here in the last
sentence: objects must conform to our conceptual scheme because that
scheme makes possible the experience of such objects.

Though elements of Kant's ‘Copernican' strategy remain unclear,
the basic idea is that Kant argues that what makes synthetic a priori
knowledge possible is the structure of our cognitive faculties,
including the pure forms of intuition and a privileged set of a priori
concepts. These forms and concepts jointly make experience possible and
allow us to draw inferences that hold with necessity and universality
concerning objects encountered in experience. What's more, Kant argues
that because a priori concepts are necessary for experience in general,
we can know that those concepts are applied legitimately, since he is
taking it as obvious that we have experience.

In these notes I give a more extensive overview of some of the central features
of Immanual Kant's "Critical" philosophy" than I did in the previous notes. We'll still have only a sketch, but at least the basic parts of Kant's theory of cognition should attain some clarity.

*** Cognition & Judgment

- Cognition (/Erkenntnis/): :: A /conscious/ representation of an object that is
     (i) determinate with respect to which object it is a representation of
     and (ii) puts one in a position to know the "real" (i.e. metaphysical)
     possibility of the object[fn:2]


- Judgment (/Urteil/): :: A combination of representations (specifically,
     concepts) in a single consciousness, whose unity is the bearer of truth
     or falsity[fn:3]

[fn:2] The genus is representation in general (/repraesentatio/). Under it
stands the representation with consciousness (/perceptio/). A perception that
refers to the subject as a modiﬁcation of its state is a sensation (/sensatio/),
an objective perception is a cognition (/cognitio/) (A320/B376)

[fn:3] The uniﬁcation of representations in a consciousness is judgment …
thinking is the same as judging or as relating representations to judgments in
general. (Prolegomena §22, 4:304)
  
*** Two Distinctions

  :CUSTOM_ID: two-distinctions
  :END:

- A priori/posteriori
  - distinction applies, in the first case, to judgments, and then

    2. 'from grounds' vs. 'from effects'
- Analytic/synthetic
  - applies to propositions
  - concerns the source or manner in which a proposition is true

[fn:5] All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided
into two kinds, to wit, relations of ideas and matters of fact. Of the first
kind are the sciences of geometry, algebra, and arithmetic; and in short,
every affirmation which is either intuitively or demonstratively
certain...Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not
ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however
great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of every matter of
fact is still possible [@hume2007, 28].

*** Kant on the A Priori
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: kant-on-the-a-priori

- A priori knowledge is /independent/ of experience in some but not all ways (e.g. for its justification but not for its acquisition)[fn:6]
  - we need experience in order for our cognitive faculties to develop
  - experience is necessary for concept acquisition
- All a priori knowledge is characterized by its universality and necessity
- A priori knowledge is knowledge of a thing from its ground or cause

[fn:6] although all our cognition commences /with/ experience, yet it
       does not on that account all arise /from/ experience. For it
       could well be that even our experiential cognition is a composite
       of that which we receive through impressions and that which our
       own cognitive faculty (merely prompted by sensible impressions)
       provides out of itself, which addition we cannot distinguish from
       that fundamental material until long practice has made us
       attentive to it and skilled in separating it out. (B1-2)

**** Conceptions of Analyticity
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: conceptions-of-analyticity
   :END:

Kant characterizes the analyticity of judgment in four different ways:

1. The predicate is 'contained' within the subject (A6-7/B11)[fn:7]
2. The predicate is 'identical' with the subject (A7/B11)
3. Analytic judgments are ones which are 'explicative' rather than
   'ampliative' (A7/B11)
4. Analytic judgments are those knowable by means of application of the
   principle of non-contradiction (A151/B190)

[fn:7] In all judgments in which the relation of a subject to the predicate is
thought...this relation is possible in two different ways. Either the predicate
/B/ belongs to the subject /A/ as something that is (covertly) contained in this
concept /A/; or /B/ lies entirely outside the concept /A/, though to be sure it
stands in connection with it. (A6/B10)

**** The Problem of Synthetic A Priori Judgment
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-problem-of-synthetic-a-priori-knowledge

- There are knowable (and known) universal/necessary/a priori judgments concerning
  reality that are /not/ explicable in terms of conceptual
  analysis[fn:8]
  - propositions of mathematics (physics & arithmetic)
  - propositions of natural science (Newtonian mechanics)


1. How are synthetic a priori judgments so much as /possible/?
2. What is the extent of our knowledge of the truth of such synthetic a priori judgments? 
   * Why must we have synthetic a priori judgment to explain knowledge of even
     the most basic relationships between elements of reality?[fn:9]

# | synthetic | +analytic+     |

[fn:9] Take the proposition 'Everything that happens has its
       cause'...the concept of a cause lies entirely outside [the
       concept of an event] and indicates something different than the
       concept of what happens in general, and is therefore not
       contained in the latter representation at all. How then do I come
       to say something quite different about that which happens in
       general, and to cognize the concept of cause as belonging to it,
       indeed necessarily, even though not contained in it? What is the
       unknown /=X/ here on which the understanding depends when it
       believes itself to discover beyond the concept of /A/ a predicate
       that is foreign to it yet which it nevertheless believes to be
       connected with it? (A9/B13)

- Can a synthetic judgment be converted to an analytic judgment by
  modification of a definition?[fn:10]

[fn:10] If one had the whole concept of which the notions of subject and
       predicate are /compartes/, synthetic judgments would be
       transformed into analytic ones. One wonders to what extent there
       is something arbitrary here. (/Notes on Metaphysics/ (c. 1769)

- Possible replies from Kant
  - Distinguish analytic from synthetic based on /logical features/ of concepts
    - Logical division by /differentia/ in terms of species/genus
      distinction\footnote{\textbf{Logical Division}: \includegraphics{/Users/Roambot/Pictures/pics/ConceptDivision.jpg}}
  - Distinguish analytic from synthetic based on proof of "objective reality"

[fn:11] the judgment in question, analytic for me, may be synthetic for another; insofar as one thinks this, another that, one more, another less, in a given concept (@maass1789, 188–89)

- Why a "Transcendental Aesthetic"? 
  - Transcendental vs. Transcendent
    - Transcendental: :: an (i) a priori condition upon which (ii) the possibility of "experience" (empirical cognition) depends[fn:13]
    - Transcendent: :: a representation (or cognition or object) of that which cannot be given in a possible experience

\\

- Transcendental Aesthetic :: a "science of all principles of a priori sensibility" (A21/B35) 

[fn:13] I call all cognition transcendental that is occupied not so much with objects but rather with our mode of cognition of objects, insofar as this is to be possible a priori

*** The Two-Stem Theory of Cognition

**** Fundamental Mental Capacities[fn:1]

- Receptivity: :: Capacity of the mind to receive representations via affection from something distinct from itself
- Spontaneity: :: Capacity of the mind to generate representations from itself without any external influence

[fn:1] Our cognition arises from two basic sources of the mind, of which
       the first is to receive the representations (the receptivity of
       impressions), the second the faculty of cognizing an object
       through these representations (spontaneity of concepts); through
       the first an object is given to us, through the second it is
       thought in relation to that representation (as mere determination
       of the mind). (A50/B74)

**** The Cognitive Faculties
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-faculties
   :END:

- Sensibility: :: passive/receptive; sensory intuitions arise from the
  affection of sensibility by objects[fn:2][fn:3]
- Understanding: :: active/spontaneous; conceptual judgments arise via
  discursive acts of the understanding[fn:4]
- Reason: :: active/spontaneous; forms inferences based on judgments
  given to it by the understanding

[fn:2] Objects are given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone
       yields us intuitions; they are thought through the understanding,
       and from the understanding arise concepts (A19/B33)

[fn:3] That representation which can be given prior to all thinking is
       called intuition (B132)

[fn:4] Our nature is so constituted that our intuition can never be
       other than sensible; that is, it contains only the mode in which
       we are affected by objects. The faculty, on the other hand, which
       enables us to think the object of sensible intuition is the
       understanding. To neither of these powers may a preference be
       given over the other. Without sensibility no object would be
       given to us, without understanding no object would be thought.
       Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts
       are blind (A51/B75)


**** Three Kinds of Representation (A320/B376-7)[fn:5]

- Sensation: :: A perception "which relates to the subject merely as a
  modification of its state"
- Intuition: :: An objective representation which "relates immediately
  to the object and is singular"
- Concept: :: An objective representation which is a "mediate [relation
  to an object], via a mark, which can be common to many things"

[fn:5] The genus is representation in general (\emph{representatio}).
       Under it stands the representation with consciousness
       (\emph{perceptio}). A perception that refers to the subject as a
       modification of its state is a sensation (\emph{sensatio}); an
       objective perception is a cognition (\emph{cognitio}). The latter
       is either an intuition or a concept (A320/B377)

**** Independent Stems?

- The two stems of cognition play different functional roles with respect to cognition[fn:6]
- The status of intuition as a form of (objective) representation independent of the understanding is unclear

  - Intellectualism: :: All objective representation depends on an act of the understanding
  - Sensibilism: :: Some objective representations do not depend on acts of the understanding

[fn:6] Objects are given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone
       yields us intuitions; they are thought through the understanding,
       and from the understanding arise concepts (A19/B33).

*** The Problem with Space
- What is space?
  - Absolutism: :: Space is a self-subsisting entity, independent of the
    objects that exist in it, and in which all existing things are
    'contained'
  - Relationalism: :: Space is the order of possible relations which hold
    between independently existing entities

*** Kant's Arguments Concerning Space

- Kant argues that neither the absolutist nor the relationalist is
  correct---space is not real but rather a 'form of intuition'

**** The Metaphysical Exposition[fn:7]

- Three questions about space:[fn:8]

  1. Ontological: what is space?
  2. Epistemological: what is the status of justification for beliefs
     concerning space?
  3. Psychological: what is the origin of (the content of) the
     representation of space?

- Four arguments concerning the status of the /representation/ of space
  and the justification for beliefs in which it figures (i.e. questions
  2 & 3)

  - 1 & 2: the representation of space is /a priori/ 
  - 3 & 4: the representation of space is /intuitive/ (i.e. non-conceptual)

[fn:7] I understand by *exposition* (/expositio/) the distinct (even if
       not complete) representation of that which belongs to a concept;
       but the exposition is /metaphysical/ when it contains that which
       exhibits the concept *as given* /a priori/. (A23/B38)

[fn:8] Now what are space and time? Are they actual entities?C Are they
       only determinations or relations of things, yet ones that would
       pertain to them even if they were not intuited, or are they
       relations that only attach to the form of intuition alone, and
       thus to the subjective constitution o f our mind, without which
       these predicates could not be ascribed to any thing at all?
       (B37-8)

**** The Transcendental Exposition[fn:9]

- The 'Argument from Geometry'[fn:10]
  - Is the argument an /additional/ argument for the conclusion that the
    representation of space is a priori and intuitive?
  - Does the argument start from the conclusion of the ME and argue for
    something else?

\newthought{The Standard Interpretation}:

1. We have synthetic a priori cognition of Euclidean geometry Or:
   Euclidean geometry is necessarily true
2. Such cognition is possible only if space is a pure intuition Or: pure
   intuition of space is a necessary condition of our synthetic a priori
   cognition of geometry
3. $\therefore$ Space is a pure intuition.

  - Goes against supposedly 'synthetic' method of the CPR
  - Is obviously unsound (viz. premise (1))

\newthought{Shabel's Alternative}:[fn:11]

1. The representation of space is a pure a priori intuition (from the
   ME).
2. From the pure a priori representation of space we can derive
   synthetic a priori propositions concerning the structure of space
3. Geometry is the science of synthetic a priori propositions concerning
   the structure of space
   - We need an explanation of (a) the a priori representation of space
     as an object and (b) the status of the propositions of geometry as
     synthetic rather than analytic.
4. Since (according to the ME) the representation of space is a priori,
   we know that the geometer's representation of its properties is
   likewise a priori.
5. Since (according to the ME) the representation of space is originally
   an intuition, we know that the status of propositions concerning the
   nature of space is ultimately synthetic.
6. $\therefore$ From the pure a priori representation of space we can
   derive and explain the synthetic a priori propositions of geometry
   --- geometric cognition depends on the representation of space
   understood in the terms set out in the ME.

[fn:9] I understand by a *transcendental exposition* the explanation of
       a concept as a principle from which insight into the possibility
       of other synthetic /a priori/ cognitions can be gained.

[fn:10] Geometry is a science that determines the properties of space
        synthetically and yet /a priori/. What then must the
        representation of space be for such a cognition of it to be
        possible? It must originally be intuition; for from a mere
        concept no propositions can be drawn that go beyond the concept,
        which, however, happens in geometry (Introduction V). But this
        intuition must be encountered in us /a priori/, i.e., prior to
        all perception of an object, thus it must be pure, not empirical
        intuition. For geometrical propositions are all apodictic, i.e.,
        combined with consciousness of their necessity, e.g., space has
        only three dimensions; but such propositions cannot be empirical
        or judgments of experience, nor inferred from them (Introduction
        II). (B41)

[fn:11] The "argument from geometry" does not analyze geometric
        cognition in order to establish that we have a pure intuition of
        space. Rather, the "argument from geometry" establishes that
        geometric cognition itself develops out of a pure intuition of
        space. The difference is subtle, but important: on the standard
        reading, our actual knowledge of geometry is traced to its
        source---namely, a pure intuition of space---in order to show
        that we must, therefore, have such a pure intuition. On my
        reading, our pure intuition of space is offered as both the
        actual source of our cognition of the first principles of
        geometry and the means for the production of further cognition
        based thereon (@shabel2004, 196)

**** The Ideality of Space

- Two conclusions:
  1. The representation of space represents nothing (and no property of
     anything) as it is in itself (A26/B42)
  2. Space (and time) is nothing other than the 'form' in which 'outer'
     things are represented (A26/B42)  
- It is not at all clear how (or whether) Kant has justification for these conclusions     
\\

- Transcendental Idealism: :: Things as they are in themselves exist, and are the ground of all appearances, but no thing as it is in itself appears in space and time[fn:12]

  
\newthought{Allais' Interpretation}:

1. Intuition necessarily involves a relation to an object[fn:14]
2. We have an a priori intuition of space (and time)
3. A priori intuition cannot, by definition, involve relating to an existing object[fn:15]
4. $\therefore$ Space is nothing other than a 'pure' a priori intuition

[fn:12] I understand by the *transcendental idealism* of all appearances
        the doctrine that they are all together to be regarded as mere
        representations and not as things in themselves, and accordingly
        that space and time are only sensible forms of our intuition,
        but not determinations given for themselves or conditions of
        objects as things in themselves. To this idealism is opposed
        *transcendental realism*, which regards space and time as
        something given in themselves (independent of our sensibility).
        The transcendental realist therefore represents outer
        appearances (if their reality is conceded) as things in
        themselves, which would exist independently of us and our
        sensibility and thus would also be outside us according to pure
        concepts of the understanding. (A369)

[fn:14] How is it possible to intuit something /a priori/? An intuition
        is a representation of the sort which would depend immediately
        on the presence of an object. It therefore seems impossible
        originally to intuit /a priori/, since then the intuition would
        have to occur without an object being present, either previously
        or now, to which it could relate, and so it could not be an
        intuition. /Prolegomena/, 4:281-2.

[fn:15] How can an outer intuition inhabit the mind that precedes the
        objects themselves? Obviously not otherwise than insofar as it
        has its seat merely in the subject, as its formal constitution
        for being affected by objects and thereby acquiring immediate
        representation, i.e., intuition of them, thus only as the form
        of outer sense in general (B41).

**** In What Sense 'Ideal'?

- Two schools of interpretation
  - 'One world': There is one set of objects, some of whose properties
    are mind-dependent
  - 'Two worlds': There are two sets of objects, one of which is mind-
    dependent

**** Incongruent Counterparts

- Three different uses of the argument
  - 1768: Space is Newtonian rather than Leibnizian
    1. Incongruent counterparts like left and right hands are
       intrinsically exactly similar
    2. Exactly similar counterparts are nevertheless differently
       'oriented'
    3. $\therefore$ Orientation of objects in space cannot be due to
       their 'internal' intrinsic, non-relational features, but must
       rather be due to something else---viz. their relation to some
       absolute space which contains them.
  - 1770: Space is intuitively not conceptually represented
    1. If representation of spatial relations were purely conceptual
       then we should be able to conceptually distinguish incongruent
       counterparts
    2. Since incongruent counterparts are qualitatively identical, there
       is no conceptual means of differentiating them
    3. $\therefore$ The fundamental representational type by which we
       distinguish spatial orientation is intuitive not conceptual
  - 1783: Space is transcendentally ideal
    - Not obvious how Kant's argument is meant to establish /ideality/
      of space

\newthought{Van Cleve's Interpretation}:[fn:16]

1. Incongruent counterparts are different in virtue of their differing
   relations to space as a whole.
2. All relations among things in themselves are reducible to the
   nonrelational qualities of the relata.
3. Therefore, if space and figures within it are things in themselves,
   one incongruent counterpart must differ internally from the other.
4. But, in fact, the counterparts do not differ internally.
5. Therefore, space itself and incongruent counterpart figures within it
   are not things in themselves.
   

- Two objections to (2)
  1. Kant didn't obviously endorse the reducibility of all relations to
     intrinsic properties of things
  2. The reducibility premise makes advertance to incongruent
     counterparts unnecessary[fn:17]

[fn:16] @vancleve1999, 47.

[fn:17] once armed with the reducibility principle, Kant need not have
        resorted to anything so recondite as incongruent counterparts to
        make his point, for spatial relations quite generally fail to be
        reducible (or "internal," in one leading sense of that term).
        Take, for example, the relation of distance: there is nothing
        about my pen and my ruler taken separately that would enable
        anyone to deduce that they are now six inches apart. So, Kant
        could simply have argued thus: all relations among things in
        themselves are reducible; distance is not a reducible relation;
        therefore, nothing in the field of the distant-from relation
        (which is to say, nothing in space) is a thing in itself.

*** Two Kinds of Logic

- Pure General Logic: :: the science of the norms or rules constitutive of
     thinking (or judging) in general, which abstracts from any relation to an
     object whatsoever (A55/B79)\footnote[][-.75in]{[Pure logic] contains the
     absolutely necessary rules of thinking, without which no use of the
     understanding takes place, and it therefore concerns these rules without
     regard to the difference of the objects to which it may be directed...A
     \textbf{general} but textbf{pure} logic therefore has to do with strictly
     \emph{a priori} principles and is a \textbf{canon of the understanding}
     and reason, but only in regard to what is formal in their use, be the
     content what it may (empirical or transcendental). (A52-3/B76-7)}

  - Abstracts from all /content/ (relation to an object) of
    thought\footnote[][.1in]{As general logic it abstracts from all contents of
    the cognition of the understanding and of the difference of its objects, and
    has to do with nothing but the mere form of thinking. (A54/B78)}
  - Purely "/formal/"

- Transcendental Logic: :: the science of the norms or rules
  constitutive of thinking of an object in general, in whatever way it
  might be given in intuition

  - /Not/ purely formal; articulates the conditions on employing the concept
    =<object>= in thinking of anything whatsoever[fn:1]
  - Articulates the most general conditions for objective thought

[fn:1] since every division presupposes a concept that is to be divided,
       a still higher one must be given, and this is the concept of an
       object in general (taken problematically, leaving undecided
       whether it is something or nothing). (A290/B346)

*** The Metaphysical Deduction[fn:2] (§§9-12)

- Function: :: mental activity by which different representations are
  ordered under a common one[fn:3]

[fn:2] In the *metaphysical deduction* the origin of the /a priori/
       categories in general was established through their complete
       coincidence with the universal logical functions of thinking, in
       the *transcendental deduction*, however, their possibility as /a
       priori/ cognitions of objects of an intuition in general was
       exhibited. (B159)

[fn:3] By a function, however, I understand the unity of the action of
       ordering different representations under a common one...Now the
       understanding can make no other use of these concepts than that
       of judging by means of them... In every judgment there is a
       concept that holds of many, and that among this many also
       comprehends a given representation, which is then related
       immediately to the object...All judgments are accordingly
       functions of unity among our representations, since instead of an
       immediate representation [viz., an intuition] a higher one, which
       comprehends this and other representations under itself, is used
       for the cognition of the object, and many possible cognitions are
       thereby drawn together into one. (A68-9/B93-4)

**** The Forms of Judgment[fn:4]

\includegraphics[height=65mm, width=90mm]{/Users/Roambot/Work/projects/phil871-kant-survey/static/materials/handouts/KantJudge.jpeg}

- Every judgment yields a "unity" (i.e. a propositional form)
  corresponding to the moments of the four types of judgment

  - Every judgment takes one moment from each group

    - Universal, affirmative, categorical and assertoric ('all crows are
      black')
    - Singular, negative, disjunctive and problematic ('that bird might
      be neither a crow nor a raven')

- Kant thinks that the 12 forms constitute all logically coherent cognitive acts which the understanding might engage in
- Kant also assumes that the only possible employment of concepts is in judgment[fn:5]

  - This is how the forms of judgment provide a 'clue' to nature of the
    categories
  - They only provide a 'clue' however, because the forms of judgment
    are /formal/ and thus lack any relation to an object---they thus cannot
    by themselves determine the content of the categories insofar as these are supposed to be concepts of /objects/

[fn:4] If we abstract from all content of a judgment in general, and
       attend only to the mere form of the understanding in it, we find
       that the function of thinking in that can be brought under four
       titles, each of which contains under itself three moments"
       (A70/B95).

[fn:5] "the understanding can make no other use of...concepts than that
       of judging by means of them. (A68/B93)

**** The Forms of Thought -- The 'Categories'

- The categories provide a dual role --- they organize both intuition
  and concepts[fn:6]

  - The dual role of the categories plus their connection to the forms
    of judgment yields (according to Kant) a determinate content---viz.
    the precise list of categories Kant provides

\includegraphics[height=71mm, width=90mm]{/Users/Roambot/Work/projects/phil871-kant-survey/static/materials/handouts/KantCats.jpeg}

\newpage

[fn:6] The same function that gives unity to the different
       representations *in a judgment* also gives unity to the mere
       synthesis of different representations *in an intuition*, which,
       expressed generally, is called the pure concept of understanding.
       The same understanding, therefore, and indeed by means of the
       very same actions through which it brings the logical form of a
       judgment into concepts by means of the analytical unity, also
       brings a transcendental content into its representations by means
       of the synthetic unity of the manifold in intuition in general,
       on account of which they are called pure concepts of the
       understanding that pertain to objects /a priori/; this can never be
       accomplished by universal logic. (A79/B105)
**** Problems
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: problems
   :END:

- Completeness: Kant presents his table of judgment as if it were
  complete, but it seems ad hoc or arbitrary[fn:7]
- Derivation: Kant claims that the all and only the categories may be
  completely derived from the table of judgment but fails to give an precise
  derivation
  - Are the categories just /identical/ with the forms of judgment?[fn:8]

[fn:7] This division is systematically generated from a common
       principle, namely the faculty for judging (which is the same as
       the faculty for thinking), and has not arisen rhapsodically from
       a haphazard search for pure concepts, of the completeness of
       which one could never be certain, since one would only infer it
       through induction, without reflecting that in this way one would
       never see why just these and not other concepts should inhabit
       the pure understanding. (A80-1/B106-7)

[fn:8] That action of the understanding...through which the manifold of given
  representations (whether they be intuitions or concepts) is brought under an
  apperception in general, is the logical function of judgments. ... But now the
  categories are nothing other than these very functions for judging, insofar
  as the manifold of a given intuition is determined with regard to them (TD
  §20, B143; cf. TD §26, B159; Pr §39, 4:324)



*** On Synthesis (§10)

- Synthesis is a form of mental /activity/; it is something the thinker /does/, not something that merely /happens/ to the thinker
  - Kant sometimes discusses synthesis as an 'act' (/Handlung/) but this
    is mildly misleading, as it may suggest that synthesis is a form of
    intentional action rather than an (at least sometimes involuntary)
    activity of the mind of which the subject may or may not be
    aware; we shouldn't confuse /acts/ of a thinker with /voluntary acts/ of a thinker[fn:9]
- Synthesis works on representations by "running through" and "gathering
  together" discrete representations into one combined and connected
  whole (A99)
  - Is synthesis a causal process?
    - No? --- would seem to be incompatible with deterministic world
    - Yes? --- realism about intentional states suggests that they have causal
      powers, and that the causal features and interactions between such
      states are what provide them with representational content and allow
      them to track logical relationships\sidenote[][-1in]{It's not just that, in
      a psychology of propositional attitudes, content and causal powers are
      attributed to the same things. It's also that causal relations among
      propositional attitudes somehow typically contrive to respect their
      relations of content, and belief/desire explanations often turn on this.
      Hamlet believed that somebody had killed his father because he believed
      that Claudius had killed his father. His having the second belief
      explains his having the first. How? Well, presumably via some such
      causal generalization as 'if someone believes Fa, then ceteris paribus
      he believes $\exists$x(Fx).' This generalization specifies a causal relation
      between two kinds of mental states picked out by reference to (the
      logical form of) the propositions they express...(Fodor 1987, 12)}
- All cognition demands a synthesis of representation[fn:11]
- Synthesis is carried out by the unitary subject of representation on
  representations that are either given to it in sensibility
  (i.e. intuition) or produced by it in thought (e.g. stipulative
  conceptual definition)
  - What Kant will attempt to show in the Deduction is that "experience"
    (in some sense of that term) depends on synthesis via application of
    the categories
- Two kinds of synthesized representations
  - Concepts
    1. Combination of concepts in one judgment
    2. Combination of simpler concepts into a more complex concept
       (cf. A729/B757; Logik Pölitz 24:568)
  - The 'manifold' of intuition (either in one intuition or many)
    1. Combination of sensations in one intuition (?)
       - This claim is controversial, as it suggests that intuition is
         constructed via synthesis
    2. Combination of intuitions into a complex intuition

[fn:9] [synthesis] is a mere effect of the of the imagination, a blind
       though indispensible function of the soul...of which we are only
       seldom even conscious (A78/B103)

[fn:10] It's not just that, in a psychology of propositional attitudes,
       content and causal powers are attributed to the same things. It's
       also that causal relations among propositional attitudes somehow
       typically contrive to respect their relations of content, and
       belief/desire explanations often turn on this. Hamlet believed
       that somebody had killed his father because he believed that
       Claudius had killed his father. His having the second belief
       explains his having the first. How? Well, presumably via some
       such causal generalization as 'if someone believes Fa, then
       ceteris paribus he believes $\exists$x(Fx).' This generalization
       specifies a causal relation between two kinds of mental states
       picked out by reference to (the logical form of) the propositions
       they express...(@fodor1987, 12)

[fn:11] By synthesis in the most general sense, however, I understand
        the action of putting different representations together with
        each other and comprehending their manifoldness in one
        cognition. Such a synthesis is pure if the manifold is given not
        empirically but a priori (as is that in space and time)...The
        synthesis of a manifold, however, (whether it be given
        empirically or a prior) first brings forth a cognition, which to
        be sure may initially still be raw and confused, and thus in
        need of analysis; yet the synthesis alone is that which properly
        collects the elements for cognitions and unifies them into a
        certain content; it is therefore the first thing to which we
        have to attend if we wish to judge about the first origin of our
        cognition. (A77-8/B103)

*** The Task of the Deduction

- Demonstrate the legitimacy of the categories

  - Legitimacy understood in terms of concepts which have their source
    in the mind (i.e. the categories) but which are correctly and
    justifiably applied to features present in experience
  - The "transcendental" nature of the argument is characterized as an
    argument which begins from obvious or uncontroversial premises and
    argues to some conclusion understood as a necessary condition for
    the possibility of the truth of those premises
  - Kant's use of '/Deduktion/' redeploys German legal vocabulary; in
    Holy Roman Empire Law, 'Deduktion' signifies an argument intended to
    yield a historical justification for the legitimacy of a property
    claim

    - In Kant's usage a deduction is an argument that aims to justify
      the use of a concept, one that demonstrates that the concept
      correctly applies to objects

  - The demonstration of their legitimacy proceeds by appealing to the
    necessary role of the categories in coming to have empirical
    /cognition/ [/Erkenntnis/] of any sort

    - Confusingly, Kant often elides this notion of empirical cognition
      with the notion of "Experience" [/Erfahrung/]

**** Grades of 'Experience'

- Kant's usage of 'experience' [/Erfahrung/] is ambiguous throughout his
  work[fn:1][fn:2]

  - (e1) having sensations
  - (e2) having sensations and being conscious of them
  - (e3) having intuitions
  - (e4) having intuitions and conceptualizing them (bringing them under
    concepts)
  - (e5) having intuitions and conceptualizing them by means of
    physical-object concepts
  - (e6) having intuitions and conceptualizing them as mine
  - (e7) having intuitions and making judgments about them
  - (e8) having intuitions and knowing propositions about them

[fn:1] In the first paragraph of the introduction to the work, Kant
        uses 'experience' in two different senses without calling the
        reader's attention to the fact. The experience with which all
        our knowledge is said to begin is "the raw material of the
        sensible impressions"; experience in this sense is then said to
        be worked up by the understanding into "that knowledge of
        objects which is entitled experience" (Bl). The same ambiguity
        runs throughout the work. (@van-cleve1999, 73)

[fn:2] Empirical cognition, however, is experience (B166). Experience
        is an empirical cognition, i.e., a cognition that determines an
        object through perceptions (A176/B218). Therefore experience
        itself -- i.e., empirical cognition of appearances -- is
        possible only in as much as we subject the succession of
        appearances, and hence all change, to the law of causality
        (A189/B234).


*** The Structure of the Deduction

- Transition (§§13-14)
- The problem of combination (§15)
- The first step (§§16-20)
- The second step (§§21-26)

**** Transition to the Deduction

- §13 On The Principles Of A Transcendental Deduction As Such

  - Discussion of a need for a transcendental as opposed to a merely
    empirical deduction.
  - This is based on the fact that an empirical deduction is unavailable
    due to two reasons -- viz.

    1) the a priori nature of the categories
    2) their semantic content includes notions of necessity and
       universality (A91-2/B124)

- §14 Transition To The Transcendental Deduction Of The Categories

  - Discussion of the nature of empirical cognition as a complex of
    intuition and concept (A92-3/B125)
  - The categories are a necessary condition for the empirical cognition
    of objects -- i.e. are necessary conditions for occurrence of
    thought about objects (of experience) (A93/B125-6)

- §15 On the possibility of a combination as such

      combination (\emph{conjunctio}) is either composition
      (\emph{compositio}) or connection (\emph{nexus}). The former is the
      synthesis of a manifold of what does not necessarily belong to each
      other...The second combination (nexus) is the synthesis of that which is

      (\emph{conjunctio}) of a manifold in general can never come to us through the
      senses, and therefore cannot already be contained in the pure form of
      sensible intuition; for it is an act of the spontaneity of the power of
      representation, and, since one must call the latter understanding, in
      distinction from sensibility, all combination, whether we are conscious
      of it or not, whether it is a combination of the manifold of intuition
      or of several concepts, and in the first case either of sensible or
      non-sensible intuition, is an action of the understanding, which we
      would designate with the general title \textbf{synthesis} in order at the same
      time to draw attention to the fact that we can represent nothing as
      combined in the object without having previously combined it ourselves,
      and that among all representations \textbf{combination} is the only one that is
      not given through objects but can be executed only by the subject
      itself, since it is an act of its self-activity. (B129-30)}
    - What is the connection of the categories with combination?\sidenote{Now
      the representation of a composite, as such, is not a mere intuition, but
      requires the concept of a compounding, so far as it is applied to the
      intuition in space and time. So this concept (along with that of its
      opposite, the simple) is one that is not abstracted from intuitions, as
      a part-representation contained in them, but is a basic concept, and a
      priori at that -- in the end the sole basic concept a priori, which is
      the original foundation in the understanding for all concepts of
      sensible objects. There will thus be as many a priori concepts resident
      in the understanding, to which objects given to the senses must be
      subordinated, as there are types of compounding (\emph{synthesis}) with
      consciousness, i.e., as there are types of synthetic unity of
      apperception of the manifold given in intuition. (\emph{Progress},

  2. demonstrate the actuality of cognitions in which the categories are
     applied (i.e. the antecedent of the conditional proven in the first

*** What is a "Transcendental Deduction"?
- The "transcendental" nature of the argument is due to its role in explaining the conditions of the possibility of experience. 
  - In contemporary philosophy, transcendental arguments are often characterized as arguments that begin from obvious or uncontroversial premises and argue to a conclusion understood as a necessary condition for the possibility of the truth of those premises
- Kant's use of '/Deduktion/' redeploys German legal vocabulary; in Holy Roman Empire Law, 'Deduktion' signifies an argument intended to yield a historical justification for the legitimacy of a property claim\sidenote[][]{Jurists, when they speak of entitlements and claims, distinguish in a legal matter between the questions about what is lawfuld (\emph{quid juris}) and that which concerns the fact (\emph{quid facti}), and since they demand proof of both, they call the first, that which is to establish the entitlement or the legal claim, the \textbf{deduction}. (B116)}
  - In Kant's usage a deduction is an argument that aims to justify the use of a concept, one that demonstrates that the concept correctly applies to objects

*** The Problem of the Deduction
- Kant aims to show that the categories, which are the logical functions of judgment in relation to given objects (i.e. to given /intuitions/ of objects), legitimately apply to such objects. Why might they not apply?
  1. A priori concepts are not derived from any experience of empirical objects, so it is not obvious why such concepts would apply to empirical objects
  2. Unlike the /forms/ of intuition, the categories are /not/ conditions under which something is given to consciousness via intuition\sidenote[][]{The categories of the understanding, on the contrary, do not represent to us the conditions under which objects are given in intuition at all, hence objects can indeed appear to us without necessarily having to be related to functions of the understanding, and therefore without the understanding containing their \emph{a priori} conditions. Thus a difficulty is revealed here that we did not encounter in the field of sensibility, namely how \textbf{subjective conditions of thinking} should have \textbf{objective validity}, i.e., yield conditions of the possibility of all cognition of objects; for appearances can certainly be given in intuition without functions of the understanding. (A89-90/B122}
- *Q_1*: If the categories are not conditions of being given something in intuition, then what are they conditions of? 
- *A_1*: The categories are conditions of our /cognition/ of objects
  - Cognition requires the determinate representation of an object
  - The categories (in combination with intuition) are responsible for this determinacy

*** What is Presupposed by the Deduction?
- *Q_2*: Is the presumption of cognition a reasonable starting point for the argument of the TD?
- *A_2*: At this point Kant need not assume that we /have/ cognition, only that /if/ we have cognition, /then/ such cognition relies on the categories. In step two, Kant argues that we have a priori cognition of space and time as objects of pure mathematics, and that this is only possible given the categories
- *Q_3*: What's the relation between cognition and experience?
  
**** Grades of 'Experience'

- Kant's usage of 'experience' [/Erfahrung/] is ambiguous throughout his
  work\sidenote[][]{In the first paragraph of the introduction to the work,
  Kant uses 'experience' in two different senses without calling the reader's
  attention to the fact. The experience with which all our knowledge is said
  to begin is "the raw material of the sensible impressions"; experience in
  this sense is then said to be worked up by the understanding into "that
  knowledge of objects which is entitled experience" (Bl). The same ambiguity
  runs throughout the work. (Van Cleve 1999, 73)}\sidenote[][]{Empirical
  cognition, however, is experience (B166). Experience is an empirical
  cognition, i.e., a cognition that determines an object through perceptions
  (A176/B218). Therefore experience itself -- i.e., empirical cognition of
  appearances -- is possible only in as much as we subject the succession of
  appearances, and hence all change, to the law of causality (A189/B234).}

*** The Structure of the Deduction

- Transition (§§13-14)
- The problem of combination (§15)
- The first step (§§16-20)
- The second step (§§21-26)

**** Transition to the Deduction

- §13 On The Principles Of A Transcendental Deduction As Such

  - Discussion of a need for a transcendental as opposed to a merely
    empirical deduction.
  - This is based on the fact that an empirical deduction is unavailable
    due to two reasons -- viz.

    1) the a priori nature of the categories
    2) their semantic content includes notions of necessity and
       universality (A91-2/B124)

- §14 Transition To The Transcendental Deduction Of The Categories

  - Discussion of the nature of empirical cognition as a complex of
    intuition and concept (A92-3/B125)
  - The categories are a necessary condition for the empirical cognition
    of objects -- i.e. are necessary conditions for occurrence of
    thought about objects (of experience) (A93/B125-6)

**** The Structure of the First Step (§§15-20)

- The primary goal of the first step is to demonstrate the truth of a
  conditional claim---viz. if there is cognition then the categories
  must play a role in its generation

  - §16 On the original synthetic unity of apperception
  - §17 The principle of the synthetic unity of apperception is the

  - §18 What objective unity of self-consciousness is
  - §19 The logical form of all judgments consists in the objective
    unity of apperception of the concepts contained in them
  - §20 All sensible intuitions are subject to the categories, which are
    conditions under which alone their manifold can come together in one
    consciousness

*** The First Step of the Deduction
**** §15---The Problem of Combination 

- §15 On the possibility of a combination as such
  - Sets up a problem (the problem of combination)
  - Explains that a "unity" is necessary for the resolution of that
    problem
    - What does Kant mean by 'combination' [/Verbindung/]\sidenote[][-4.5in]{All
      combination (\emph{conjunctio}) is either composition
      (\emph{compositio}) or connection (\emph{nexus}). The former is the
      synthesis of a manifold of what does not necessarily belong to each
      other...The second combination (nexus) is the synthesis of that which is
      manifold insofar as they necessarily belong to one
      another...(B201-2)}
    - Why can't combination be given in intuition?\sidenote[][-3.5in]{the combination
      (\emph{conjunctio}) of a manifold in general can never come to us through the
      senses, and therefore cannot already be contained in the pure form of

    - What is the connection of the categories with combination?\sidenote[][-.5in]{Now
      the representation of a composite, as such, is not a mere intuition, but
      requires the concept of a compounding, so far as it is applied to the

      priori at that -- in the end the sole basic concept a priori, which is
      the original foundation in the understanding for all concepts of
      sensible objects. There will thus be as many a priori concepts resident
      in the understanding, to which objects given to the senses must be
      subordinated, as there are types of compounding (\emph{synthesis}) with
      consciousness, i.e., as there are types of synthetic unity of
      apperception of the manifold given in intuition. (\emph{Progress},
      20:271)}



\newpage
**** §16---The Original Synthetic Unity of Apperception

\newthought{Thinkability \& Mineness}

1. A representation is /thinkable/ if and only if it is /self-consciously/ thinkable\sidenote[][]{The \textbf{I think} must \textbf{be able} to accompany all my representations; for otherwise something would be represented in me that could not be thought at all, which is as much as to say that the representation would either be impossible or else at least would be nothing to me. (B131–2)}
2. A representation counts as /mine/ if, and only if, it is self-consciously thinkable
3. $\therefore$ All my representations must be thinkable


\newthought{Self-Consciousness \& Numerical Identity}

1. If a representation is /mine/, then I must be able to represent myself as numerically identical\sidenote[][]{the representation \textbf{I think}, which must be able to accompany all others and which in all consciousness is one and the same (B132)}
2. The representation of my self-identity itself depends on my ability to combine representations in a single consciousness\sidenote[][]{it is only because I can combine a manifold of given representations \textbf{in one consciousness} that it is possible for me to represent the \textbf{identity of the consciousness in these representations} itself, i.e., the \textbf{analytical} unity of apperception is only possible under the presupposition of some \textbf{synthetic} one. (B133-4)}
3. $\therefore$ Insofar as I represent /myself/ (i.e. am conscious of my identity), I must possess the capacity to synthesize or combine representations in one consciousness



- Apperception: :: self-consciousness, or consciousness of one's representations
- Original Apperception: :: the fundamental productive power of self-consciousness\sidenote[][]{that self consciousness which, because it produces the representation \textbf{I think}, which must be able to accompany all others and which in all consciousness is one and the same, cannot be derived from any other (B132)}
  - Note that this means the "I think" is not to be identified with original apperception, but is rather its /product/
- Transcendental Apperception: :: the unity of self-consciousness upon which cognition or experience depends\sidenote[][]{I also call its unity the \textbf{transcendental} unity of self-consciousness in order to designate the possibility of a priori cognition from it. (B132)}


**** §17---Relation to an Object/Objects as Unities

1. All unification of representations demands a unity of consciousness in their synthesis
2. The representation of an object is a unity of representations\sidenote[][]{The \textbf{understanding} is, to speak generally, the faculty of \textbf{cognitions}. These consist in the determinate relation of given representations to an object. But an \textbf{object} is that in the concept of which the manifold of a given intuition is united. (B137)}\sidenote[][]{What is an object? That whose representation is a sum of several predicates belonging to it. The plate is round, warm, made of tin, etc. Warm, round, being made of tin, etc., are not objects, although the warm [thing], the tin [thing], etc., indeed [are]. An object is that in the representation of which various others can be thought as synthetically combined… (R6350, 18:676)}
3. $\therefore$ A unity of consciousness is necessary for the relation of representations to an object (or more simply, for the representation of an "object" in Kant's sense)


\newpage
**** §18---Necessity and Universality

1. Experience contains representation of objective simultaneity and succession
2. Representation of objective simultaneity and succession requires representation of universality and necessity
3. The empirical unity of consciousness generated by association cannot explain the possibility of such representation\sidenote[][]{Whether I can become \textbf{empirically} conscious of the manifold as simultaneous or successive depends on the circumstances, or empirical conditions. Hence the empirical unity of consciousness, through association of the representations, itself concerns an appearance, and is entirely contingent\ldots{}One person combines the representation of a certain word with one thing, another with something else; and the unity of consciousness in that which is empirical is not, with regard to that which is given, necessarily and universally valid. (B140)}
4. $\therefore$ Associationism is insufficient for explaining representation involving necessity and universality


**** §19---Judgment & Synthesis

1. We distinguish between mere subjective association of concepts and objective judgment
2. Objective judgment involves a relation between two concepts that transcends particular contingent facts concerning their relation by a particular subject\sidenote[][]{In accordance with the {[}laws of association{]} I could only say "If I carry a body, I feel a pressure of weight," but not "It, the body, is heavy," which would be to say that these two representations are combined in the object, i.e., regardless of any difference in the condition of the subject, and are not merely found together in perception (however often as that might be repeated).}
3. This distinction cannot be accounted for by a merely associationist account of the mind
4. There are no other plausible explanations besides associationism and the synthesis theory
5. $\therefore$ Only synthesis explain the objective status of judgment\sidenote[][]{a judgment is nothing other than the way to bring given cognitions to the objective unity of apperception (B141)}

   
**** §20---Intuition & Synthesis

1. Intuition of an /object/ requires a unified 'manifold'
2. The unity of a manifold is brought about by the unity of apperception
3. The unity of apperception brings about the unity of a manifold via an act of judgment in accordance with one of the logical forms
4. The categories are the rules of combination by which each of the logical functions of judgment is carried out with respect to intuition
5. $\therefore$ Any intuition of an object must conform to the categories

   
- *Q_4*: Why doesn't the Deduction end here?
- *A_4*: There are two remaining issues
  1. We haven't yet seen that there is "experience" or cognition of objects
  2. There are important negative aspects of the view that Kant seeks to explain

*** Overview

- The first step:
  - §§15-20
  - Argues for the general claim that if we have cognition the
    categories are necessary for cognition
    - Problem of combination (§15) and its solution: what explains the possibility of
      complex representation, necessary both for representing oneself
      and for representing objects?
- The second step
  - §§21-26
  - Argues for:
    1. the truth of the antecedent of the above conditional---viz. that
       we have cognition via the categories
    2. the denial that we cognize ourselves as we are in ourselves
    3. the denial that the categories may provide cognition of anything
       independently of intuition

*** The Second Step (§§21-26)

- *Problem*: Is the step redundant?\sidenote[][-2.5in]{Therefore all manifold,
  insofar as it is given in one empirical intuition, is \textbf{determined} in
  regard to one of the logical functions for judgment, by means of which,
  namely, it is brought to a consciousness in general. But now the
  \textbf{categories} are nothing other than these very functions for judging,
  insofar as the manifold of a given intuition is determined with regard to
  them (§13). Thus the manifold in a given intuition also necessarily stands
  under categories. (B143)}

  
**** §21 - The Categories and Givennes

- The deduction is not yet complete, we need to account for how empirical
  intuition, rather than intuition in general, is subsumed under the
  categories\sidenote[][-2in]{In the above\ldots{}the beginning of a
  \textbf{deduction} of the pure concepts of the understanding has been
  made\ldots{}In the sequel (§ 26) it will be shown from the way in which the
  empirical intuition is given in sensibility that its unity can be none other
  than the one the category prescribes to the manifold of a given intuition in
  general (B144-5)}
- The categories are necessary for cognition only for subjects with /discursive/
  rather than /intuitive/ understanding\sidenote[][-1.25in]{In the above proof,
  however, I still could not abstract from one point, namely, from the fact
  that the manifold for intuition must already be \textbf{given} prior to the
  synthesis of understanding and independently from it; how, however, is here
  left undetermined. For if I wanted to think of an understanding that itself
  intuited (as, say, a divine understanding, which would not represent given
  objects, but through whose representation the objects would themselves at
  the same time be given, or produced), then the categories would have no
  significance at all with regard to such a cognition. (B145)}
- An intuitive intellect does not cognize by means of the categories[fn:4]

[fn:4] if our understanding were intuitive, it would have no objects
       except what is actual...Thus the distinction of possible from
       actual things is one that is merely subjectively valid for the
       human understanding (CJ 5:401-2)

**** §§22-3 - Restricting the Categories to Phenomena

- Thinking is not /cognizing/[fn:5]

  - Thinking concerns what is /logically/ possible (i.e. what is not contradictory)
  - Cognizing concerns what is /really/ possible 
    - Metaphysical notion
    - Based on the coherence or combinability of predicates/properties,
      understood as 'positive determinations' or 'realities', in a
      single subject[fn:6]
      - predicate canceling
      - subject canceling

\newthought{Kant's Verificationism?}:

\noindent Kant claims that all of our concepts, including the
categories, have 'sense and significance' [/Sinn und Bedeutung/] (B149)
only insofar as they are applicable to objects of experience.[fn:7]

- Is Kant's principle of sense an epistemological or a semantic thesis?

  - Not obviously a semantic thesis since Kant seems to allow for
    regimented discussion of transcendent subject matter (e.g. rational
    theology, 'magnetic matter' (A226/B273))
  - Given the thinking/cognizing distinction, Kant may be linking the
    meaning of 'sense and significance' to his notion of 'real
    possibility'


[fn:5] To *cognize* an object, it is required that I be able to prove
       its possibility (whether by the testimony of experience from its
       actuality or a priori through reason). But I can *think* whatever
       I like, as long as I do not contradict myself, i.e., as long as
       my concept is a possible thought, even if I cannot give any
       assurance whether or not there is a corresponding object
       somewhere within the sum total of all possibilities. 

[fn:6] [N]ot every concept in which there is no contradiction is a
       possible synthesis --- that is, real relations are not seen
       through the principle of contradiction (/Notes on Metaphysics/
       R4004 (1769), 17:382).

[fn:7] The pure concepts of the understanding, consequently, even if
       they are applied to a priori intuitions (as in mathematics),
       provide cognition only insofar as these a priori intuitions, and
       by means of them also the concepts of the understanding, can be
       applied to empirical intuitions. Consequently the categories do
       not afford us cognition of things by means of intuition except
       through their possible application to *empirical intuition*,
       i.e., they serve only for the possibility of *empirical
       cognition*. This, however, is called *experience*. The categories
       consequently have no other use for the cognition of things except
       insofar as these are taken as objects of possible experience.
       (B147-8)

**** §§24-5 - Figurative Synthesis & Self-Knowledge

- Distinction between the kind of (intellectual) synthesis necessary to
  generate propositional judgment and the concepts which constitute it,
  and (figurative) synthesis necessary to generate unitary (complex?)
  sensible intuitions[fn:8]

[fn:8] The same function that gives unity to the different
       representations in a judgment also gives unity to the mere
       synthesis of different representations in an intuition, which,
       expressed generally, is called the pure concept of understanding.
       (A79/B105)

**** §26 - Completing the Deduction

- Kant argues that our representations of space and time themselves
  "contain a manifold" and thus require a synthesis if they are to be
  represented as objects
- Since space and time themselves are synthesized by the categories all
  possible appearances and space and time will likewise be conditioned
  or "determined" by the categories
  - the crux of 'conceptualist' readings of the Deduction depend on an
    interpretation of the B160-161 footnote according to which it argues
    that the representation of space and time /as pure intuitions/ depends
    on a 'figurative' synthesis guided by the categories[fn:9]

[fn:9] these same properties that, in the Transcendental Aesthetic, are
       arguments in favor of the \emph{intuitive} rather than
       \emph{discursive} nature of our representations of space and
       time, become, in section 26, reasons to assert that these
       intuitions are made possible by acts of a priori synthesis. And
       the a priori synthesis that generates space and time as a priori
       intuitions, also generates the conformity of the manifold of
       empirical intuitions to the \emph{categories} (@longuenesse1998,
       215; cf. @guyer2010a, 146).

*** The Conceptualist Argument According to Griffith

**** Some Key Assumptions
- There is no intentionality without synthesis[fn:10]
- Intuitions are to be identified with perceptions in roughly our
  contemporary sense---viz. sensory presentations of objects in
  space---but this claim about perception is not obviously tracking
  Kant's use of the term 'perception' [/perceptio///wahrnehmung/]
  - One reply to the conceptualist argument as Griffith presents it
    is that it simply misses any claim concerning intuition, and only is
    successful, if at all, against the higher-order consciousness of
    particular representations rather than the occurence of the
    representations themselves

[fn:10] synthesis and intentionality are not logically distinct: only a
        synthesized intuition is an intentional intuition.
        (@griffith2012, 201)

**** The Arguments

\newthought{The Argument from a Threefold Synthesis}

1. Objective perception requires the generation of a 'perceptual
   image'[fn:11]
2. Perceptual images are generated via a threefold empirical synthesis
3. The empirical synthesis of sensation depends on the 'affinity of the
   manifold'
4. The affinity of the manifold depends on a transcendental synthesis of
   pure intuition by the categories
5. $\therefore$ All objective perception depends on the
   categories[fn:12]


- *Problems*:
  - no discussion of the transcendental unity of apperception (i.e. where
    did Kant's emphasis on consciousness go?)
  - against premise (1) --- Kant seems to deny both that:
    1. we think in terms of images[fn:13]
    2. we infer from the existence and character of images to the
       existence and character of their causes[fn:14]

\newthought{The Argument from the Unity of Pure Intuition}

1. There is no synthesis of apprehension without the unity of pure
   intuition
2. The unity of pure intuition depends on the categories---viz. the
   categories of quantity
3. $\therefore$ the synthesis of apprehension depends on the categories
   [1, 2]
4. Perception depends on the synthesis of apprehension
5. $\therefore$ Perception depends on the categories [3, 4]


- *Problems*:
  - We cannot make sense of Kant's arguments concerning pure intuition in
    the Transcendental Aesthetic if pure intuitions of space and time
    depend on synthesis according to the categories of quantity[fn:15]
    - Synthesis is an iterative form of construction of wholes in terms of
      parts, but the mereological structure of pure intuition defines the
      parts in terms of the whole
    - Kant consistently characterizes the nature of the understanding's
      activity as limited to grasping wholes in terms of their parts,
      which is in contrast to the intuitive intellectual grasp of wholes
      prior to their parts characteristic of God[fn:16]

[fn:11] Mere sensibility, it seems, can only supply us with impressions
        that are 'dispersed and separate in the mind', but it cannot, as
        [Kant] says, 'bring the manifold of intuition into an image'
        (A120). Thus, if there is no synthesis to combine a dispersed
        manifold into an image, then there is no empirical intuition
        (perception), hence no possible vehicle for nonconceptual
        content (in the sense we are discussing). (@griffith2012, 201)

[fn:12] empirical intuition requires a rule-guided synthesis of its
        manifold, which depends on the affinity of the manifold, which
        presupposes a figurative synthesis of the pure manifold, which
        in turn is related to the transcendental unity of apperception,
        the source of the rules for this pure synthesis: the categories.
        (@griffith2012, 206)

[fn:13] In fact it is not images of objects but schemata that ground our
        pure sensible concepts. No image of a triangle would ever be
        adequate to the concept of it. For it would not attain the
        generality of the concept, which makes this valid for all
        triangles, right or acute, etc., but would always be limited to
        one part of this sphere. (A140-1/B180)

[fn:14] Thus the transcendental idealist is an empirical realist, and
        grants to matter, as appearance, a reality which need not be
        inferred, but is immediately perceived. (A371)

[fn:15] First, one can only represent a single space; and when one
        speaks of many spaces, one means by that only parts of one and
        the same unique space. Nor, second, can these parts precede the
        one all-encompassing space, as its constituents, as it were
        (from which it can be assembled); rather, they can be thought
        only as in it. Space is essentially one; the manifold in it, and
        hence also the universal concept of spaces as such, rests solely
        on limitations (A24-5/B39)

[fn:16] we can also conceive of an understanding which, since it is not
        discursive like ours but is intuitive, goes from the
        synthetically universal (of the intuition of a whole as such) to
        the particular, i.e., from the whole to the parts, in which,
        therefore, and in whose representation of the whole, there is no
        contingency in the combination of the parts, in order to make
        possible a determinate form of the whole, which is needed by our
        understanding, which must progress from the parts, as
        universally conceived grounds, to the different possible forms,
        as consequences, that can be subsumed under it. (CJ 5:407)

*** The Aims of the Analytic of Principles
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-aims-of-the-analytic-of-principles
  :END:

- Four questions:
  1. /Which/ concepts are a priori? (the Metaphysical Deduction)
  2. /Must/ the categories apply to objects of experience? (the
     Transcendental Deduction)
  3. /How/ could the categories apply to objects of experience? (the
     Schematism)
  4. /What/ synthetic a priori truths do we know as the result of their
     application? (the System of All Principles)

\noindent The Analytic of Principles aims to answer questions (3) and (4). A
full vindication of the categories thus depends not only on the arguments of
the Analytic of Concepts but also those of the Principles.

*** The Schematism (A137-47/B176-87)
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:

**** The Aim of Kant's Argument
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-aim-of-kants-argument
   :END:

- What's the scope of Kant's argument?

  1. Specific: explain how /the categories/, whose content is purely
     a priori, and based on the functions of judgment, apply to object of experience
  2. General: explain how /any/ /concept/ applies to an object of experience

**** The Homogeneity Requirement[fn:1]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-homogeneity-requirement121822
   :END:

- Homogeneity: :: Two representations(?) X and Y are (partially)
  homogeneous iff X and Y share (some of) the same content

- What is /Homegeneity/ a problem for?

  - All concepts as they relate to objects via intuition? (Pendlebury)
  - Pure (a priori) concepts as they relate to objects via intuition?
    (Guyer)

[fn:1] In all subsumptions of an object under a concept the
       representations of the former must be *homogeneous* with the
       latter, i.e., the concept must contain that which is represented
       in the object that is to be subsumed under it, for that is just
       what is meant by the expression "an object is contained under a
       concept." (A137/B176).

**** Guyer's Interpretation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: guyers-interpretation
   :END:

- Empirical concepts are their own schemata[fn:2]
  - Empirical concepts relate 'immediately' to schemata (A141/B180)
    - Why would the schematism be a 'hidden art' then? (A141/B180-1)
  - Avoids empiricist problem of abstract ideas
- Schemata are required only for pure concepts\sidenote[][.75in]{the problem
  is that the \emph{content} of the pure concepts of the understanding does
  not include any predicates which do directly designate any properties of
  pure or empirical intuition...Although being four-footed or triangular is
  something that may be \emph{both} thought in a concept and directly
  presented in the appropriate kind of intuition, being \emph{real} or \emph{a
  ground of a consequence} – that is, possessing the property which is the
  objective correlate of the logical function of affirmation or the logical
  relation of antecedent to consequent – is not the kind of property that is
  directly presented in pure or empirical intuition. (Guyer (1987, 165)}

\newthought{Kant's 'Tertium Quid' -- Time}

- Kant requires an intermediary that is homogeneous with both the
  categories and appearances, as well as being
  - /universal/: applies to all appearances
  - /knowable a priori/: allows for knowledge of the a priori
    applicability of the categories to appearances
  - /diverse/: compatible with the full variety of logical properties
    and relations specified by the categories
- Only the representation of time and temporal relations satisfies all
  three conditions
  - Allows for a distinctive form of anti-skeptical argument since Kant
    also argues that representation of determinate temporal relations
    depends on the spatial content of representation[fn:3]

[fn:2] The rule by which the reproductive imagination /represents/ a dog
       or the understanding /recognizes/ an object presented to it as a
       dog is just the rule that anything which displays four-footedness
       (and of course a number of other similarly sensible properties,
       such as certain characteristics of dentition, musculature, and so
       on) is to be called a "dog," and this rule is precisely the rule
       signified by the concept /dog/. In other words, the rule which
       functions as a schema is the concept signified by the expression
       "dog." (@guyer1987-ch6, 164)

[fn:3] By beginning with the premise that the categories can be
       interpreted in the purely temporal forms of inner sense, but then
       arguing that the determinate temporal relations of subjective
       states thus called for can be judged only if those states are
       also linked to independent objects in space, Kant can show that
       the categories can be given empirical /sense/ in terms of
       knowledge which even the skeptic must concede...but that they can
       be /used/ only if knowledge of external reality is also conceded.
       (@guyer1987-ch6, 168)

**** Pendlebury's Interpretation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pendleburys-interpretation
   :END:

- The schematism concerns the /general/ problem of how /concepts/ apply
  to objects via the subsumption of intuitions under concepts
  - The categories are only a special instance of a general problem
- The Homogeneity Requirement is understood in terms of /shared
  representational content/ between representations (i.e. intuition and
  concept)[fn:4]
  - How can an intuition and a concept have (or share) the same
    representational content?
- Kant's solution is /not/ to appeal to a /tertium quid/ but rather to
  appeal to a pre-conceptual capacity for synthesis which is 'excercised
  in both the formation and the application of concepts'[fn:5]
  - Schemata are fundamentally /dispositions/ to group 'bare'
    (i.e. non-representational) sensations[fn:6]

[fn:4] an intuition, i, and a concept, C, are homogeneous if and only if
       C-ness is part of the /content/ of i. Here and elsewhere in this
       paper I use the word "content" in the sense which is now common
       in the philosophy of mind and language...one representation
       subsumes another if the content of the latter includes the
       content of the former. (@pendlebury1995, 781)

[fn:5] @pendlebury1995, 784

[fn:6] my inclination would be to define a schema canonically as the
       (repeatable) /process-type/ which yields the relevant synthesis.
       In terms of this suggestion, Kant is most accurate when he
       describes a schema as a rule, for there is a minimal sense in
       which a rule is in effect a process-type, viz., the sense in
       which it is not something which an agent obeys or follows, but
       something which a particular sequence of event tokens fits or
       instantiates. (@pendlebury1995, 786n15)

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-analogies

- Principles concerning truths generated from application of the
  categories of /relation/ (=<substance>=, =<cause>=, =<community>=)
- *Q_1*: What is an "analogy"?[fn:18][fn:19]
- *Q_2*: Are the analogies making epistemic or metaphysical claims?

[fn:18] [An analogy is] not the identity of two *quantitative* [relations, as in mathematical analogy] but [the identity] of two *qualitative* relations, where from three given members I can cognize and give /a priori/ only the *relation* to a fourth member but not *this* fourth *member* itself, although I have a rule for seeking it in experience and a mark for discovering it there (B222)

[fn:19] An analogy of experience will therefore be only a rule in accordance with which unity of experience is to arise from perceptions (not as a perception itself, as empirical intuition in general), and as a principle it will not be valid of the objects (of the appearances) *constitutively* but merely *regulatively*. (B222)

  law of the connection of cause and effect (B231)

- *Q_3*: What is an "alteration"?[fn:20]  
- *Q_4*: What are the relata of the cause-effect relation?
  - events (standard reading)
  - substances & their causal powers (Watkins 2005)
- *Q_5*: Is a disparity between the causal relata fatal for the existence of a real dispute between Hume and
  Kant?[fn:1]

[fn:1] What we're left with on Watkins's view by way of clear variation
       from broadly Humean theories is that Kant invokes irreducible
       active causal powers and, by contrast with Hume's own view, the
       first relatum of a causal relation can persist beyond an instant.
       It remains unclear whether the idea that causal powers or grounds
       are indeterminate diverges from what broadly Humean theories
       might endorse. (@chignell2010b, 586)

[fn:20] the concept of alteration presupposes one and the same subject as
existing with two opposed determinations, and thus as persisting (B233; cf. B230)

**** The Argument(s) of the Second Analogy
- *Q_6*: How many arguments are there in the Second Analogy?[fn:21]
  1. Argument from faculty psychology[fn:22]
  2. Argument concerning objective vs. subjective time determination
- *Q_7*: How do we connect the argument to Hume? 
  - According to Hume representation of causal relations is based on the
    habitual connection of sequences of constant conjunction
  - The Humean argument presupposes that we can distinguish the objective
    sequence of events from our subjective train of sense experiences (
    e.g. representation of the house vs. the riverboat)
    - How is this possible on the Humean model?
    - According to Kant temporal order depends on the application of a rule
      for objectively ordering a time series--i.e. depends on the concept
      =<cause>=

[fn:21] This section, as Kant very rightly felt, contains one of the most
important and fundamental arguments of the entire Critique; and this would
seem to be the reason why he has so multiplied the proofs which he gives of
the Analogy. Within the limits of the section no less than five distinct
proofs are to be found, and still another was added in the second edition.
[@kempsmith2003, 363]

[fn:22] connection is not the work of mere sense and intuition, but is here
rather the product of a synthetic faculty of the imagination, which determines
inner sense with regard to temporal relations. (B233)

1. We cannot experience that an [objective] event---that is, a
   transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring solely by knowing any of the
   following (either individually or jointly)
   a) that the perceptions of A and B occur in the order A, B
   b) that the perceptions of A and B are irreversible
   c) that A precedes B by reference to absolute time
   d) that these perceptions are of successive states of things-in-themselves.
2. If (1), then the only way we can experience that an event is
   occurring is by knowing that B follows A according to a rule, that is, that
   the event has a cause.
3. If the only way we can experience that an event has a cause, then
   any event such that we can know of its occurrence by experience must have a
   cause.
4. $\therefore$ Any event such that we can know of its occurrence by experience must
   have a cause.[fn:23]

[fn:2] [@dicker2004, 173].

[fn:23] if therefore we experience that something happens, then we presuppose that something precedes it on which it follows according to a rule (B240)

*** Phenomena & Noumena
- Positive vs. Negative conception of "noumena"[fn:24]
  - Positive: objects that can be known only by a non-sensible (intellectual) intuition
  - Negative: objects that cannot be sensibly intuited or connected via
    sensible laws to such an intuition[fn:25]

[fn:24] If by a noumenon we understand a thing *insofar as it is not an object of our sensible intuition*, because we abstract from the manner of our intuition of it, then this is a noumenon in the *negative* sense. But if we understand by that an *object of a non-sensible intuition*, then we assume a special kind of intuition, namely intellectual intuition, which, however, is not our own, and the possibility of which we cannot understand, and this would be the noumenon in a *positive* sense. (B307)

[fn:25] the doctrine of sensibility is...the doctrine of the noumenon in the negative sense, that is, of things which our understanding must think without reference to our mode of intuition, therefore not merely as appearances but as things in themselves. (B307)
*** Transcendental Idealism, Things in Themselves, & Noumena
- Things in themselves exist since they are the basis of appearances[fn:26]
  - Transcendental Idealism posits the existence of noumena in the negative sense only

[fn:26] from the concept of an appearance in general...something must correspond to it which is not in itself appearance, for appearance can be nothing for itself and outside of our kind of representation; thus, if there is not to be a constant circle, the word "appearance" must already indicate a relation to something the immediate representation of which is, to be sure, sensible, but which in itself, without this constitution of our sensibility...must be something, i.e., an object independent of sensibility...from this arises the concept of a /noumenon/ (A252)


*** The Aims of the Dialectic

- Critique of traditional metaphysics/metaphysical reasoning
- Articulation of the root of metaphysical error
  - The role of reason in metaphysical error
    - Transcendental Illusion
    - The 'Ideas of Reason'

*** Transcendental (Dialectical) Illusion

- The intellectual illusion that we have access to non-sensible
  objects---viz. God, the soul, and the world-whole[fn:1]
  - Principles that are only legitimately applied to objects of a
    possible experience are applied outside the context of any possible
    experience, as if they were nevertheless legitimate
- Transcendental Illusion is an unavoidable product of our reason[fn:2]

[fn:1] *transcendental illusion* [contains principles] which instead,
       contrary to all the warnings of criticism, carries us away beyond
       the empirical use of the categories, and holds out to us the
       semblance of extending the pure understanding. (A295/B352)

[fn:2] The cause of this is that in our reason (considered subjectively
       as a human faculty of cognition) there lie fundamental rules and
       maxims for its use, which look entirely like objective
       principles, and through them it comes about that the subjective
       necessity of a certain connection of our concepts on behalf of
       the understanding is taken for an objective necessity,the
       determination of things in themselves. [This is] an illusion that
       cannot be avoided at all. (A297-B353-4)

**** Reason & Explanation (Reason in its 'logical use')

- The three faculties
  - Sensibility provides the material for concepts & judgments
  - Understanding generates concepts and judgments from what is given in
    sensibility
  - The faculty of reason aims to connect judgments in inferential
    chains (syllogisms)
- Reason seeks to /explain/ what is given to it by the
  understanding[fn:3]
- Two uses of reason
  1. /Descending/
    - movement from condition to conditioned
    - subsuming objects of cognition under general principles
  2. /Ascending/
    - movement from conditioned to condition
    - articulating general principles under which objects of cognition
      may be subsumed
    - Reason seeks the condition for anything that is given to it until
      it finds the /unconditioned/ condition of everything
    - Reason seeks to /unify/ cognition, so as to subsume the largest
      number of objects of cognition under the smallest number of
      principles[fn:4]

[fn:3] what is unique to reason on Kant's view is that it demands a
       complete explanation for given facts. The function of reason is
       not to generate experience in the first place, which is the task
       of the understanding working together with sensibility
       (A307/B363--4). Instead...judgments about experience are the
       starting points or input for reason. Reason's basic function is
       to ask about any given empirical judgment: /why/? Moreover, once
       reason finds an answer to this question, it subjects that answer
       in turn to the same question: /why/? (@rohlf2010, 195)

[fn:4] reason, in inferring, seeks to bring the greatest manifold of
       cognition of the understanding to the smallest number of
       principles (universal conditions), and thereby to effect the
       highest unity of that manifold. (A305/B361)

*** A Critique of Pure Reason

- Reason's demand for the unconditioned condition of everything causes
  it to illegitimately apply logical principles in a metaphysical way
- Kant critiques reason in its 'pure' (a priori/real/non-logical) use --
  we can have no knowledge through reason alone, but only the illusion
  of knowledge[fn:5]

[fn:5] the question is: Does reason in itself, i.e., pure reason,
       contain a priori synthetic principles and rules, and in what
       might such principles consist? (A306/B363)

**** Transcendental Ideas (Reason in its 'real use')

Idea: a concept made of up notions, which goes beyond the possibility of
experience (A320/B377)
- Reason produces its own concepts
  - Assumes the existence of supersensible objects of those concepts
    - Assumes that we can have synthetic a priori knowledge of such
      objects[fn:6]

\newthought{The three transcendental ideas of reason:}[fn:7]

1. Psychology: the conditions of the unity of the subject
   - The soul
2. Cosmology: the conditions of unity of the series of appearances
   - The world whole (or cosmos)
3. Theology: the absolute unity of the conditions of all objects in
   general
   - God

[fn:6] this logical maxim [to find the condition for a given conditioned
       claim] cannot become a principle of *pure reason* unless we
       assume that when the conditioned is given, then so is the whole
       series of conditions subordinated one to the other, which is
       itself unconditioned, also given (i.e., contained in the object
       and its connection). Such a principle of pure reason, however, is
       obviously *synthetic*; for the conditioned is analytically
       related to some condition, but not to the unconditioned.
       (A307-8/B364)

*** Problems

**** Some Objections

1. Reason's two 'parts' in ascending and descending, lack unity
  - Ascending reason is non-inferential
  - Descending reason is purely inferential
     - Kant's focus on syllogism and on categorical syllogism in
       particular threatens the generality of his claims
2. There is no clear distinction between the understanding and reason
  - Understanding 'ascends' and 'descends' too
    - Reply: focus on the kinds of 'unities' that result from the
      activities of the distinct faculties[fn:7]
3. Is transcendental illusion really /necessary/?
  - Does Kant's position merely reflect the interests of German
    philosophy at his time?

[fn:7] If the understanding may be a faculty of the unity of appearances
       by means of rules, then reason is the faculty of the unity of the
       rules of the understanding under principles. (A302/B358-9)

**** Worries About Derivation

- What is Kant's route to the specific ideas of the soul, cosmos, and
  God?[fn:8]
  - Connection between the forms of syllogism, the categories of
    relation, and the ideas seems /arbitrary/, or at least artificial

[fn:8] Now what is universal in every relation that our representations
       can have is (1) the relation to the subject, (2) the relation to
       objects, and indeed either as appearances or as objects of
       thinking in general. If we combine this subdivision with the
       above division, then all the relation of representations of which
       we can make either a concept or an idea are of three sorts: (1)
       the relation to the subject, (2) to the manifold of the object in
       appearance, and (3) to all things in general...The thinking
       subject is the object of psychology, the sum total of appearances
       (the world) is the object of cosmology, and the thing that
       contains the supreme condition of the possibility of everything
       that can be thought (the being of all beings) is the object of
       theology. (A333--4/B390--1)


\newpage

*** The Structure of the Dialectic

- The dialectical syllogisms
  - Categorical (the soul)
    - The Paralogisms
      - substantiality, simplicity, unity/identity, relation to outer objects
  - Hypothetical (the cosmos)
    - The Antinomies
      - Mathematical, Dynamical
  - Disjunctive (God)
    - The Ideal of Pure Reason
      - The transcendental ideal, Ontological argument, Cosmological argument, Physico-theological argument (argument from design)

*** Reason as Regulative

- The ideas of reason can have a positive use by acting as maxims for
  theory construction and the creation of a unified theory of
  nature[fn:9]
- Reason lacks a 'constitutive' use in that it has no genuine objects,
  other than what may be given to it by the understanding
  (A643-4/B671-2)
- The error of traditional metaphysics is thus to mistake a 'regulative'
  principle for a 'constitutive' one[fn:10]

[fn:9] This unity is, of course, only a 'projected' unity (A647/B675),
        a mere ideal, but it has significance for how we approach the
        empirical world. Kant gives the following illustrations: under
        pressure from reason, we will search for fundamental (chemical)
        elements and powers in nature (A646/B674, A648--9/B676--7),
        employ concepts of ideal entities not to be found in nature
        (e.g. pure earth, water and air, A646/B674), develop hypotheses
        advancing universal laws of nature (A646--7/B674--5) and
        classify the organic and inorganic natural worlds into genera
        and species (A653--7/B681--5). The operative maxims are the
        three principles of 'genera', 'specification' and 'affinity',
        instructing us to seek out respectively 'homogeneity', 'variety'
        and 'continuity' among natural forms (A651--64/B679--92).
        (@gardner1999, 144)

[fn:10] the transcendental ideas are never of constitutive use, so that
        the concepts of certain objects would thereby be given, and in
        case one so understands them, they are merely sophistical
        (dialectical) concepts...however, they have an excellent and
        indispensably necessary regulative use...of directing the
        understanding (A644/672)

[fn:11] There will be as many concepts of reason as there are species of
       relation represented by the understanding by means of the
       categories; and so we must seek an *unconditioned*, *first*, for
       the *categorical* synthesis in a *subject*, *second* for the
       *hypothetical* synthesis of the members of a *series*, and
       *third* for the disjunctive synthesis of the parts in a *system*.
       (A323/B379)

*** Empirical v. Rational Psychology

- Empirical psychology is concerned with what may be learned via inner
  observation of one's mental states[fn:1]
- Rational psychology concerns what may be deduced from the a priori
  knowledge of oneself as a /thinking subject/[fn:2]
  - provides knowledge of the essence or nature of thinking beings in
    general
  - provides knowledge of objects that are not objects of a possible
    experience

[fn:1] If more than the /cogito/ were the ground of our pure rational
       cognition of thinking beings in general; if we also made use of
       observations about the play of our thoughts and the natural laws
       of the thinking self created from them: then an empirical
       psychology would arise (A347/B405)

[fn:2] *I think* is thus the sole text of rational psychology, from
       which it is to develop its entire wisdom...because the least
       empirical predicate would corrupt the rational purity and
       independence of the science from all experience. (A343/B401)

*** Two Kinds of Self-Consciousness
- The "critical" Kant construes self-consciousness as fundamentally /bifurcated/
  

- Inner sense (empirical apperception): :: passive sensory representation of the subject as object\sidenote[][-.70in]{The consciousness of ourself in accordance with the determinations of our state in inner perception is merely empirical, forever variable; it can give no standing or abiding self {[}\emph{stehendes oder bleibendes Selbst}{]} in this stream of inner appearances, and is customarily called \textbf{inner sense} or \textbf{empirical apperception}. (On the Synthesis of Recognition in a Concept, A107)}
     
- Pure Apperception: :: /sui generis/, active, non-sensory (intellectual) representation of the subject as a subject[fn:27]\sidenote[][]{The consciousness of myself in the representation I is no intuition at all, but a merely intellectual representation of the self-activity of a thinking subject. (Refutation of Idealism, B278; see also B132, B157, B423)}

[fn:27] now I want to become conscious of myself only as thinking; I put to
one side how my proper self is given in intuition, and then it could be a mere
appearance that I think, but not insofar as I think; in the consciousness of
myself in mere thinking I am the being itself, about which, however, nothing
yet is thereby given to me for thinking. (B-Paralogisms, General Remark B429)




*** Questions About Inner Sense & Pure Apperception :noexport:

- *Q_{1}*: What kinds of subjective states are candidates for awareness in inner sense? - feelings, pain & pleasure - sensations - thoughts/judgments? 
- *Q_{2}*: If inner sense provides only a consciousness of discrete subjective states, then how could it ever provide first-person knowledge?\footnote[][]{[representations] could still (I consider myself as an animal) carry on their play in an orderly fashion, as connected according to empirical laws of association, and thus they could even have inﬂuence on my feeling and desire, without my being conscious of my own existence (assuming that I am even conscious of each individual representation, but not of their relation to the unity of representation of their object, by means of the synthetic unity of their apperception). This might be so without my cognizing the slightest thing thereby, not even what my own condition [\emph{Zustand}] is (To Marcus Herz, May 26, 1789; C 11:52).}
- *Q_{3}*: In what way does inner sense (empirical apperception) depend on pure apperception?\footnote[][]{All empirical consciousness, however, has a necessary relation to a transcendental consciousness (preceding all particular experience), namely the consciousness of myself, as original apperception. (Transcendental Deduction A117, note)}

*** The Paralogisms

- Instance of Transcendental Illusion
- All paralogisms are syllogistic inferences[fn:3] with three
  distinguishing characteristics
  - fallacious categorical syllogism exhibiting an error of equivocation
    between the major premise and the minor premise[fn:4]
  - formally invalid but has true premises[fn:5]
  - as an instance of TI, must involve a plausible and compelling error
    

1. All M are P---major premise
2. S is M---minor premise
3. $\therefore$ S is P---conclusion

[fn:3] All basic syllogisms consist of three categorical sentences (e.g.
       'S is P'), in which the two premises share exactly one term,
       called the 'middle term', and the conclusion contains the other
       two terms, sometimes called the 'extremes'. The 'major' premise
       is general, the 'minor' premise singular. The 'major' and 'minor'
       terms figure in their respective premises. (SEP, "Ancient Logic")

[fn:4] [A paralogism] arises when the middle concept is taken in
       different senses in the two premises---when, namely, the
       /logical/ relation (in thinking) in one of the premises is taken
       as a real one (of the objects of intuition) in the other. (R
       5552; 18:218; cf. A402 and B411)

[fn:5] A *paralogism* is a syllogistic inference that is false as far as
       its form is concerned, although as far as its matter (the
       antecedent propositions) are concerned [/bei Vordersätzen/], it
       is correct. (R 5552; 18:218)

*** The First Paralogism -- Substantiality

**** A-edition Version (A348)

1. That which is the subject of judgment and cannot be predicated of
   anything else is substance.
2. I, as a thinking being, am the *absolute subject* of all my possible
   judgments, and this representation of Myself cannot be used as the
   predicate of any other thing.
3. $\therefore$ I, as thinking being (soul), am *substance*.

\newthought{Problems}:

- Premise (1) is not a major premise but rather a definition
- Premise (2) is not sufficiently general
  
**** B-edition Version (B410-11)

1. What cannot be thought otherwise than as subject does not exist
   otherwise than as subject, and is therefore substance.[fn:6]
2. Now a thinking being, considered merely as such, cannot be thought
   otherwise than as subject.
3. $\therefore$ A thinking being also exists only as such a thing, i.e.,
   as substance.


- Invalid inference because of an equivocation in the use of
  'thought'[fn:7]
- The 'logical' use of 'I' is mistaken for a 'real' use in denoting a
  purely intellectually graspable, 'unschematized' conception of
  substance.[fn:8]

[fn:6] 'does not' should read 'cannot'?

[fn:7] 'Thought' [/Das Denken/] is taken in an entirely different
       meaning [/Bedeutung/] in the two premises: in the major premise,
       as it applies to an object in general (hence as it may be given
       in intuition); but in the minor premise only as it subsists in
       relation to self-consciousness, where, therefore, no object is
       thought, but only the relation to oneself as subject (as the form
       of thinking) is represented. (footnote, B 411-12)

[fn:8] the first syllogism of transcendental psychology imposes on us an
       only allegedly new insight when it passes off the constant
       logical subject of thinking as the cognition of a real subject of
       inherence, with which we do not and cannot have the least
       acquaintance, because consciousness is the one single thing that
       makes all representations into thoughts, and in which, therefore,
       as in the transcendental subject, our perceptions must be
       encountered; and apart from this logical significance of the I,
       we have no acquaintance with the subject in itself that grounds
       this I as a substratum, just as it grounds all thoughts.

[fn:9] something can exist only as *subject*, not as mere determination
       of other things, i.e., can be substance (B288)

[fn:10] the I that I think can always be considered as *subject*, and as
        something that does not depend on thinking merely as a
        predicate...does not signify that I as *object* am for myself a
        *self-subsisting being* or *substance*. (B407)

**** A Gap in the Conception of Substance?
- There is a gap between the category =<substance>= as derived from the logical structure of thought, and the category as a "schematized" concept of experience 
    - <substance>$_L$: the grammatical conception of a term which always takes subject rather than predicate place in a judgment[fn:28]
    - <substance>$_E$: the experiential conception of the persisting and permanent substratum of change[fn:29]
- There is further conception of substance between the grammatical/logical & the experiential 
    - <substance>$_M$: the purely metaphysical conception of a subject of inherence (whether persistent or not), which does not itself inhere in anything
- What could be the source of this conception of substance?
  - Cannot be analytically derived from <substance>$_L$
  - Cannot be derived from content of intuition
- The concept <substance>$_M$ (perhaps along with the other categories) derives from pure apperception\sidenote[][-.9in]{[The principles of] the objective determination of all representations, insofar as cognition can come from them...are all derived [abgeleitet] from the principle of the transcendental unity of apperception. (Transcendental Deduction §19, B142).}\sidenote[][]{Apperception is itself the ground of the possibility of the categories, which for their part represent nothing other than the synthesis of the manifold of intuition, insofar as that manifold has unity in apperception. \ldots{} Hence of the thinking I (the soul), which {[}thus represents{]} itself as substance\ldots{}one can say \emph{not so much} that is cognizes \emph{itself through the categories}, but that it cognizes the categories, and through them all objects, in the absolute unity of apperception, and hence cognizes them \emph{through itself}. (Observation on the sum of the pure doctrine of the soul, A401)}

[fn:28] [Substance is that which] must always be considered as subject,
    never as mere predicate (Transition to the Deduction, B129; see also
    B186)

[fn:29] The schema of substance is the persistence of the real in time,
    i.e., the representation of the real as a substratum of empirical
    time-determination in general, which therefore endures while
    everything else changes. (Schematism, A144/B183)

*** The Second Paralogism -- Simplicity  (A351-61/B407-8)

1. That thing whose action can never be regarded as the concurrence of
   many acting things, is simple. (All A is B)
2. Now the soul, or the thinking I, is such a thing. (C is A)
3. $\therefore$ The soul is a simple thing (substance). (C is B)


- Known as the 'Achilles' argument\sidenote[][.1in]{This is the Achilles of all the dialectical inferences of the pure doctrine of the soul, nothing like a mere sophistical play that a dogmatist devised in order to give his assertions a fleeting plausibility, but an inference that seems to withstand even the sharpest testing and the greatest scruples of inquiry. (A351)}
- Paralogism consists in the confusion in the use of 'thing' (logical
  vs. real)

\newthought{Revised Version}:


1. The subject whose action can never be regarded as the concurrence of
   many acting things, is simple. (All A is B)
2. The self is such a subject. (C is A)
3. $\therefore$ The self is simple. (C is B)


- Confusion hinges on logical vs. real notion of 'subject'
  - 'Logical' sense of subject appeals to First Paralogism argument of a
    representation that could never function as a predicate
  - 'Real' sense of subject as something like a substance_{1}

\newthought{The 'Nervus Probandi' of Achilles}:\sidenote[][-1.8in]{Every composite substance is an aggregate of many, and the action of a composite, or of that which inheres in it as such a composite, is an aggregate of many actions or accidents, which is distributed among the multitude of substances...[Now] suppose that the composite were thinking; then every part of it would be a part of the thought, but the parts would first contain the whole thought only when taken together. Now this would be contradictory. For because the representations that are divided among different beings (e.g., the individual words of a verse) never constitute a whole thought (a verse), the thought can never inhere in a composite as such. Thus it is possible only in one substance, which is not an aggregate of many, and hence it is absolutely simple. (A351-2)}

- (UC): :: if a multiplicity of representations are to form a single
  representation, they must be contained in the absolute unity of the
  thinking substance. (A352)

- RP depends on the inference from unity of thought to 'absolute' unity
  of thinker
  - 'absolute unity' refers to a thinker which has no proper parts

- Kant: why think that the structure of a thought, as a complex, isn't
  mirrored by the structure of the entity, as a complex substance, which
  thinks it?\sidenote[][-.5in]{For the unity of the thought, which consists of many
  representations, is collective, and as far as mere concepts can show may
  relate just as well to the collective unity of different substances acting
  together (A353)}
  - (UC) isn't analytic
  - (UC) isn't synthetic a priori\sidenote[][]{Nor will anyone venture to assert that this proposition allows of being known synthetically and completely \emph{apriori} from mere concepts - not, at least, if he understands the ground of the possibility of \emph{apriori} synthetic propositions, as above explained. (A353)}

*** The Third Paralogism (A361-66/B408)

1. What is conscious of the numerical identity of its Self in different
   times, is to that extent a person. (All C is P)
2. Now the soul is conscious of the numerical identity of its Self in
   different times. (S is C)
3. $\therefore$ The soul is a person. (S is P)


- Reminiscent of Locke's characterization of personhood in the
  /Essay/[fn:15]
  - Is Kant's discussion one concerning specifically /personal/
    identity?
    - establishing synchronic and diachronic criteria of identity
  - Is Kant dealing with the Wolffian conception of personality?[fn:16]
    - establishing criteria for distinguishing persons from animals via
      elaboration of the complex of intellectual powers necessary for
      personhood, and which would be sustained after the destruction of
      one's body.[fn:17]
- The ambiguity of the middle term: consciousness of numerical
  identity[fn:18]
  - logical unity of grammatical subject
  - real unity of metaphysical subject

[fn:15] [being a person requires a capacity for a being to think of] it
       self as it self, the same thinking thing in different times and
       places (@locke1970, 335; II.xxvii.9)

[fn:16] Wolff claims that "a thing is called a person that is conscious
       that it is the very same thing that was previously in this or
       that state" (DM § 924), which definition clearly evokes Locke's
       original in making the (actual) consciousness of identity
       essential to personhood. (@dyck2010, 99)

[fn:17] For Kant, the soul's consciousness of its numerical identity, as
       ultimately a consciousness of the identity of /apperception/, is
       evidence of the soul's possession of an understanding. Animals,
       by contrast, do not possess an understanding but only its
       analogue...That the personality of the human soul signals the
       possession of an understanding thus serves to distinguish the
       human soul from that of an animal... (@dyck2010, 120)

[fn:18] The proposition of the identity of myself in everything manifold
       of which I am conscious is equally one lying in the concepts
       themselves, and hence an analytic proposition; but this identity
       of the subject, of which I can become conscious in every
       representation, does not concern the intuition of it, through
       which it is given as an object, and thus cannot signify the
       identity of the person, by which is understood the consciousness
       of the identity of its own substance as a thinking being in all
       changes of state (B408).

*** The Cosmological Ideas & the Antinomies of Reason

- Four cosmological ideas corresponding to the four classes of the table
  of categories
  1. Composition (quantity/the totality of appearances)
  2. Division (quality/reality of matter in space)
  3. Generation (relation/causation)
  4. Dependence (modality/of the contingent on the necessary)
- Each cosmological idea concerns the unconditioned condition of a given
  '/regressive/' series[fn:1]
- Consideration of each idea yields two possible answers concerning the
  relation of conditioned to condition[fn:2]
  - *Thesis*: the series of conditioned conditions terminates in a first
    member of the series which is itself unconditioned:
    1. There is a first event/largest quantity of matter
    2. There is simple substance
    3. There is a first (free) cause
    4. There is a necessary being
  - *Antithesis*: the series of conditioned conditions goes on to
    infinity, with every member presupposing a further given condition
    in the series
- Kant considers both thesis and antithesis to be valid arguments, which he
  thinks indicates a problem with how reason approaches these topics[fn:3]
  - Which was more important to the 'critical' Kant's development---the
    antinomies or Hume's arguments concerning the concept =<cause>=?

**** The Conditioning Relation

- x conditions y: :: y so depends on x that had x not been, y could not
  have been.
- x R-conditions y: :: There is an irreflexive and transitive relation R
  such that for all x and for all y, if xRy, then x conditions y in
  virtue of the fact that xRy.

- *Thesis*: Something that is not R-conditioned must exist as the first
  member of the R-conditions of any given φ.
- *Antithesis*: All the R-conditions of any given φ are themselves φs,
  hence R-conditioned by further φs to infinity.

  - If A conditions B and B conditions C, why must it be the case that A
    thereby conditions C?
    - Assumption of transitivity is required to articulate the
      antithesis, but is not itself argued for.
- Why is there a problem with the existence of an infinite series?
  - Three notion of 'infinite series'
    - Infinite in progression (no end)
    - Infinite in regression (no beginning)
    - Infinite /simpliciter/ (no beginning or end)[fn:4]
  - Isn't the existence of the conditioned entity enough to provide
    evidence that the requisite conditions have been fulfilled?


*** The Third Antinomy
**** The Thesis Argument

- Thesis: :: Causality in accordance with laws of nature is not the only
  one from which all the appearances of the world can be derived. It is
  also necessary to assume another causality through freedom in order to
  explain them. (A444/B472)
  

1. The only form of causation is natural causation. [Assumption for
   reductio]
2. $\therefore$ Every event that occurs has a cause. [1, definition of
   causation]
3. $\therefore$ There is no /first/ cause of events and thus no complete regression
   of the causal series. [1, 2]
4. However, the content of the causal law demands that there /be/ a complete regression if the causal series is to exist. [definition of causation][fn:9]
5. $\therefore$ Contradiction. [3, 4]
6. $\therefore$ There must exist a spontaneous cause---one that is not determined by a
   prior ground. [Negation of 1][fn:10]

**** The Antithesis Argument

- Antithesis: :: There is no freedom, but everything in the world
  happens solely in accordance with laws of nature. (A445/B473)
  
  
1. There is an uncaused beginning (i.e. a free beginning) to the causal series
   of appearances. [Assume for reductio]
2. For everything that happens, there must a previous state from which it is
   causally determined according to a natural law.[fn:12] [definition of causation]
3. $\therefore$ If a spontaneous cause happens (or begins to act), there must be a previous state from which it follows (causally) in accordance with a natural law [from 2]
4. $\therefore$ The action of a spontaneous cause follows a previous state (causally) in accordance with a natural law [1, 3]
5. $\therefore$ Contradiction [1, 4]
6. $\therefore$ There can be no freedom or first cause. [Negation of 1]


*** Resolving the Antinomy
**** The General Solution: Transcendental Idealism
- The Antinomies are /generated/ because (i) for any given conditioned thing (e.g. appearance) the whole set of conditions must also be given; (ii) in each instance the Thesis and Antithesis present arguments showing that the series of conditions of the object that is given both can and cannot be complete\sidenote[][]{The entire antinomy of pure reason rests on this dialectical argument: If the conditioned is given, then the whole series of all conditions for it is also given; now objects of the senses are given as conditioned; consequently, etc. (A497/B525)}
- The Antinomies are /resolved/ because the condition-conditioned relationship applies differently to appearances than to things in themselves.\sidenote[][]{If the conditioned as well as its condition are things in themselves, then when the first is given,\ldots{}the latter is thereby really already given along with it (A498/B526) {[}In contrast{]} if I am dealing with appearances\ldots{}then I cannot say with the same meaning that if the conditioned is given, then all the conditions (as appearances) for it are also given. \ldots{} For the \textbf{appearances}, in their apprehension, are themselves nothing other than an empirical synthesis (in space and time) and thus are given only \textbf{in this synthesis} (A498-99/B527)}
  - The condition(s) of appearances are set as a task for reason to resolve, rather than as a given totality\sidenote[][]{{[}for appearances{]} if the conditioned is given, then through it a regress in the series of all conditions for it is \textbf{given} to us \textbf{as a problem} (A497--498/B526)}
  - The appearance of an object is indeterminate in a way that things in themselves are not
    - Things in themselves are completely determinate in the sense that for every pair of contradictory predicates one of them must be truly ascribed to each thing in itself (A571–576/B599–604).
    - Appearances are /representations/ and so must be apprehended and synthesized to become determinate appearances of /objects/ 
    


\newpage
**** Resolving the Third Antinomy
- The Thesis & Antithesis are (possibly) true of different subject matter
  - The Thesis’s assertion of freedom is possible for things in themselves---but not for appearances---while the Antithesis’s assertion of determinism is true for appearances---but may be false for things in themselves (see A531–532/B559–560)
- Premise (3) of Antithesis argument assumes temporal determinacy of the cause but the spontaneity of a thing in itself is atemporal, and so needn't entail the problematic conclusion in (4)\sidenote[][]{the argument holds for appearances, which are necessarily temporally determinate, but not for things in themselves, since they are, in some sense, atemporal and thus not temporally determinate, either. By thus distinguishing between temporal appearances and atemporal things in themselves, Transcendental Idealism creates room for the possibility that things in themselves could be free. (Watkins 2005, 316)}
*** Freedom

**** Two Ways of Conceiving of Free Action
- Source Requirement: :: An agent's volition to act is free only if she
  is the proper source of the volition
- Leeway Requirement: :: An agent's volition to act is free only if it
  is (really) possible that the agent could either $\phi$ or $\neg\phi$

****  Kant's Combination of The Requirements
- 'Source' requirement is necessary for free action and imputability
  - Structure of the phenomenal world is incompatible with an agent's
    being the proper source of her actions[fn:6]
- 'Leeway' requirement is necessary for a system of 'oughts' to apply
  - The possibility of leeway depends on our satisfying the source
    requirement[fn:8]

\newpage    
**** Two Kinds of Freedom

- Practical Freedom: :: the capacity to act in accordance with ends
  distinct from those dictated by one's immediate sensible
  impulses\footnote[][-.7in]{we have a capacity to
     overcome impressions on our sensory faculty of desire by representations of
     that which is useful or injurious even in a more remote way (Canon,
     A802/B830)}\footnote[][]{We thus cognize practical freedom through
     experience, as one of the natural causes, namely a causality of reason in
     the determination of the will, whereas transcendental freedom requires an
     independence of this reason itself (with regard to its causality for
     initiating a series of appearances) from all determining causes of the
     world of the senses (Canon, A803/B831)}
- Transcendental Freedom: :: the power to (i) initiate a causal series
  from oneself (ii) without being determined by causal factors beyond
  one's control\footnote[][]{the
  power of beginning a state \emph{of itself} [\emph{von selbst}]--the
  causality of which does not in turn stand under another cause determining
  it in time in accordance with the law of nature. (A533/B561); cf. (A446/
  B474)}

**** Control & Freedom
- Control Condition: :: One is in control just in case one is the
  ultimate causal source of some effect, without being causally
  determined either by (i) temporally antecedent conditions or (ii)
  one's own nature\footnote[][-.5in]{Since the
  past is no longer in my control, every action that I perform must be
  necessary by determining grounds \emph{that are not within my control},
  that is, I am never free at the point in time in which I act. (CPrR
  5:94)}\footnote[][]{One might raise the objection that God cannot decide
  otherwise than he does, and so he does not act freely but from the
  necessity of his nature.\ldots{}but in God it is not due to the necessity
  of his nature that he can decide only as he does, but rather it is true
  freedom in God that he decides only what is in conformity with his highest
  understanding. (\emph{Pölitz Religion}, PR132/28:1068 (1783/4); cf. Rel
  5:50n)}


- Control does not require leeway of action (i.e. the capacity to do or
  refrain)
- Kant is a "source" rather than a "leeway" incompatibilist

[fn:1] I will call the synthesis of a series on the side of the
       conditions, thus proceeding from the condition proximate to the
       given appearance toward the more remote conditions, the
       *regressive* synthesis

[fn:2] Each of these two competing answers gives us a different
       interpretation of the more basic rational idea of a
       /world-whole/, and thus two incompatible interpretations of the
       constitution of a world (or nature) as a whole, between which we
       apparently have to choose. The choice, moreover, seems an
       impossible one, since whichever way we respond to each of the
       cosmological questions, our answer seems open to insuperable
       objections...The impossibility of each alternative can be
       represented by an argument for and against the existence of an
       object corresponding to each cosmological idea. This threatens us
       with a set of contradictions: There /must/ be, yet there also
       /cannot/ be, a first event in time, a largest quantity of the
       world in space, a simple substance, a first or free cause, a
       necessary being. (@wood2010, 248)

[fn:3] [the Antinomies] first aroused me from my dogmatic slumber and
       drove me to the critique of reason itself, in order to resolve
       the scandal of ostensible contradiction of reason with itself
       (Letter to Christian Garve, 1798; 12:258).

[fn:4] Why should we worry about the infinity of an "ascending" or
       "regressive" series - in the direction of the condition - any
       more than we worry about the infinity of a "descending" or
       "progressive" series - from each condition to what it
       conditions?...The antinomies work on us because there is a
       philosophical inclination, having a profound grip on us, that
       some things depend on other things in a systematic series, and
       that the connectedness among things that makes them constitute a
       single world, or a whole of nature, involves the transitivity of
       these essentially /asymmetrical/ relations of conditioning or
       dependency. (@wood2010, 250)

[fn:5] *Freedom in the practical sense* is the independence of the power
       of choice from *necessitation* by impulses of sensibility...in
       the human being there is a faculty of determining oneself from
       oneself, independently of necessitation by sensible impulses.
       (A534/B562)

[fn:6] For from the [necessity in causal relations] it follows that
       every event, and consequently every action that takes place at a
       point in time, is necessary under the condition of what was in
       the preceding time. Now, since time past is no longer within my
       control, every action that I perform must be necessary by
       determining grounds /that are not within my control/, that is, I
       am never free at the point of time in which I act. (CPrR:
       Critical Elucidation of the Analytic, 5:94)

[fn:7] [practical freedom] presupposes that although something has not
       happened, it ought to have happened, and that its cause in
       appearance is not therefore so determining that it excludes a
       causality of our will---a causality which, independently of those
       natural causes, and even contrary to their force and influence,
       can produce something that is determined in the time-order in
       accordance with empirical laws, and which can therefore begin a
       series of events /entirely of itself/. (CPR: Resolution of the
       Cosmological Idea, A534/B562)

[fn:8] Now that this reason has causality, or that we can at least
       represent something of the sort in it, is clear from the
       /imperatives/ that we propose as rules to our powers of execution
       in everything practical...It is impossible that something in
       [nature] /ought to be/ other than what, in all these
       time-relations, it in fact is; indeed the ought, if one merely
       has the course of nature before one's eyes, has no significance
       whatever. (A547/B575).

[fn:9] the law of nature consists just in this, that nothing happens
       without a cause sufficiently determined /a priori/ (A446/B474)

[fn:10] a causality must be assumed through which something happens
        without its cause being further determined by another previous
        cause, i.e., an *absolute* causal *spontaneity* beginning *from
        itself* a series of appearances that runs according to natural
        laws, hence transcendental freedom, without which even in the
        course of nature the series of appearances is never complete on
        the side of the causes. (A446/B474)

[fn:11] not only will a series begin absolutely through this
        spontaneity, but the determination of this spontaneity itself to
        produce the series, i.e., its causality, will begin absolutely,
        so that nothing precedes it through which this occurring action
        is determined in accordance with constant laws. (A446/B474)

[fn:12] Every beginning of action, however, presupposes a state of the
        not yet acting cause, and a dynamically first beginning of
        action presupposes a state that has no causal connection at all
        with the cause of the previous one, i.e., in no way follows from
        it. (A446/B474)

*** A Metaphysics of Morals

- Morality is the science of the will and its laws[fn:1]
  - Morality possess both a 'pure' and an 'empirical' part with the pure
    part providing a justification and explanatory base for the
    empirical[fn:2]
- We need a metaphysics of morals, just as we did a metaphysics of
  nature
  - Explain universality & necessity: if there are moral laws they hold
    universally and with necessity, and for that reason must be a
    priori[fn:3]
  - Buttress and guide existing moral practice[fn:4]

[fn:1] Formal philosophy is called *logic*, whereas material philosophy,
       which has to do with determinate objects and the laws to which
       they are subject, is once again twofold. For these laws are
       either laws of /nature/ or of /freedom/. The science of the first
       is called *physics*, that of the other is *ethics*; the former is
       also called doctrine of nature, the latter doctrine of morals.
       (Preface, 4:387)

[fn:2] all moral philosophy is based entirely on its pure part; and when
       it is applied to the human being it does not borrow the least
       thing from acquaintance with him (from anthropology) but gives to
       him, as a rational being, laws a priori... (Preface, 4:389)

[fn:3] Everyone must admit that a law, if it is to hold morally, i.e. as
       the ground of an obligation, must carry with it absolute
       necessity; that the command: thou shalt not lie, does not just
       hold for human beings only, as if other rational beings did not
       have to heed it; and so with all remaining actual moral laws;
       hence that the ground of the obligation here must not be sought
       in the nature of the human being, or in the circumstances of the
       world in which he is placed, but a priori solely in concepts of
       pure reason (4:389)

[fn:4] morals themselves remain subject to all sorts of corruption as
       long as we lack that guideline and supreme norm by which to judge
       them correctly. For in the case of what is to be morally good it
       is not enough that it /conform/ with the moral law, but it must
       also be done /for its sake/; if not, that conformity is only very
       contingent and precarious...(Preface, 4:390)

**** Aim of the /Groundwork/

- Open an 'entirely new field' of study concerning the nature of a
  /pure/ will and the capacity to motivated by reason alone[fn:5]
- /Not/ aiming to provide a metaphysics of morals
  - The content of the /Groundwork/ is largely in abstraction from
    whatever concrete demands morality may make of us
- Aims to :
  1. Articulate the 'supreme principle of morality' (4:392)
     - 'analytic' vs. 'synthetic' method[fn:6]
  2. Show that this principle is indeed the most basic and general of
     all moral principles

[fn:5] let it not be thought that what is here called for already
       exists...and that we do not therefore have to open up an entirely
       new field. ... For the metaphysics of morals is to investigate
       the idea and the principles of a possible pure will, and not the
       actions and conditions of human willing in general, which are
       largely drawn from psychology.

[fn:6] [The analytic method requires that we begin with] something
       already known to be dependable, from which we can go forward with
       confidence and ascend to the sources which are not yet known, and
       whose discovery not only will explain what is known already, but
       will also exhibit an area with many cognitions that all arise
       from these same sources. (/Prolegomena/ §4, 4:275; cf. §5, 4:276)

**** Structure of the /Groundwork/

- First section: "Transition from common rational to philosophic moral
  cognition."
  - Regression from 'common concept' -- viz. =<duty>= to its
    constituents
  - First articulation of the moral law
- Second section: "Transition from popular moral philosophy to
  metaphysics of morals."
  - Disqualification of the 'popular' conception of morality
    - Return to analysis of the 'common concept'
  - Analysis of maxims and imperatives
  - Analysis of the moral law as a 'categorical' imperative
    - The moral law is a priori
    - The possibility of moral obligation depends on the possibility of
      a will that is 'autonomous' or free
- Third section: "Final step from metaphysics of morals to the critique
  of pure practical reason."
  - Break from 'analytic' method of previous sections
    - Argument from the conditions of autonomy (freedom) to the fact
      that we are free and autonomous
    - Analysis of the concepts =<duty>= and =<rational will>= cannot
      demonstrate that human beings are /in fact/ autonomous
  - 'Proof' of the status of human beings as possessing free and
    rational will

**** Structure of /Groundwork/ I

- The good will is the only unconditional good (4:393-4)
- The 'natural purpose' of reason is a morally good will, not happiness
  (4:394-6)
- The analysis of the concept =<duty>= (4:397-401)
- Conformity to a law, as such, is the condition of a will that is good
  in itself (4:402-3)
- Common & philosophical cognition of morality & the dialectic of
  practical reason (4:403-5)

*** The Good Will

- The only unconditionally good thing is a 'good will'[fn:7]
  - A good will is good because of what motivates it, not because of
    what it does or accomplishes[fn:8]
  - Nothing bad can result from a good will, if it does then this is the
    result of poor judgment (or stupidity)

[fn:7] It is impossible to think of anything at all in the world, or
       indeed even beyond it, that could be considered good without
       limitation except a good will. (4:393)

[fn:8] A good will is good not because of what it effects, or
       accomplishes, not because of its fitness to attain some intended
       end, but good just by its willing, i.e. in itself.and, considered
       by itself, it is to be esteemed beyond compare much higher than
       anything that could ever be brought about by it in favour of some
       inclination, and indeed, if you will, the sum of all
       inclinations. Even if by some particular disfavour of fate, or by
       the scanty endowment of a stepmotherly nature, this will should
       entirely lack the capacity to carry through its purpose; if
       despite its greatest striving it should still accomplish nothing,
       and only the good will were to remain ...then, like a jewel, it
       would still shine by itself, as something that has its full worth
       in itself. Usefulness or fruitlessness can neither add anything
       to this worth, nor take anything away from it. (4:394)

*** The Analysis of =<duty>=

- Three propositions
  - Proposition 1: an action is morally good if and only if it is done
    from duty
  - Proposition 2: the moral worth of a dutiful act lies in the quality
    of its maxim
  - Proposition 3: duty is the necessity of an action from respect for
    the law

**** Inclination & Duty -- The Four Examples

Distinguish between:

1. Actions (merely) coinciding with duty that are performed as a means
   to satisfying a higher-order inclination directed at some other
   object.
2. Actions (merely) coinciding with duty, performed from an immediate
   inclination towards some object.
3. Actions that (coincide with duty and) are performed solely for the
   sake of duty.
4. Actions that are done contrary to duty because of some other
   immediate or higher-order inclination.

   
- Kant's four cases are specifically illustrations of the second point above:
  - The shopkeeper (4:397)
  - Preserving one's life (4:397-8)
  - Beneficent action (4:398)
  - Caring for one's happiness (4:399)


- Avoid an easy misconception based on these cases: Kant is /not/
  arguing that morally valuable dutiful acts /require/ that one fail to
  enjoy or otherwise identify with the action they perform, as one might
  think is the case with a virtuous person
  - Duty is not a /purpose/, it is the (moral) ground for adopting a
    purpose[fn:9]

[fn:9] See [@korsgaard1989a, 324-6; @wood2008, ch. 2].

**** Questions about Proposition 1

- There is some controversy as to what the actual first proposition is
  -- Kant does not explicitly state it[fn:10]
- Options:

  1. There is nothing unconditionally good other than a good will
     - Fails to explain how (3) follows from (1) and (2)
  2. An action from duty is an action from respect for the moral law
     - Construes (1) as 'subjective', (2) as 'objective' and (3) as
       their combination
     - Cannot account for the fact that discussion of respect and the
       notion of a 'principle of the will' or practical law (4:400)
       occur /after/ the first proposition is presumably introduced
  3. The concept of duty contains the concept of the good will 'under
     certain subjective limitations and hindrances' (4:397) - Fails to
     explain how (3) follows from (1) and (2)

[fn:10] the standard view is that this unformulated proposition states
        that an action has moral worth if and only if it is performed
        from duty alone. This is the most natural reading, since this
        thesis seems be the main import of the argument of the preceding
        paragraphs and it makes for a smooth transition to the
        introduction of the second proposition, which is concerned with
        the source of moral worth. Nevertheless, this reading has
        sometimes been called into question, usually on the grounds that
        it does not appear to be compatible with Kant's claim that the
        third proposition is a consequence of the first two.
        (@allison2011, 122)

**** Questions about Proposition 2

- What is a 'maxim'?[fn:11]
  - Designates an action to be performed in a type of situation and for
    some purpose because it is good (In C, I ought (may, etc.) to A, for P because it is G)
  - Distinguish between:
    1) I will knock Alex down, in order to remove him from the path of an oncoming bullet.
    2) I will knock Alex down, in order to relieve my temper.
    3) I will punch a punching bag, in order to relieve my temper.
  - (1) is (at least) permissible while (2) is wrong, but not simply because
    of the /action/ undertaken in (1), understood as bodily behaviour
  - (3) is permissible, but not simply because of the /intention/ rather than any bodily behavior
  - What matters is the /relation/ between action and intention -- viz. the 'form' of the maxim

[fn:11] A /maxim/ is the subjective principle of willing; the objective
        principle (i.e., the one that would also subjectively serve all
        rational beings as the practical principle if reason had
        complete control over the desiderative faculty) is the practical
        /law/. (4:400, note)

**** Questions about Proposition 3
- The third proposition is supposed to follow from the first two, but how?
- What is /respect/? Is it a feeling?[fn:12]
- If duty is an action from respect for the law, then isn't duty an action from feeling rather than reason?[fn:13]

  
- Intellectualism: ::  resepect is a purely intellectual recognition of the moral law sufficient for generating moral action
- Affectivism: :: moral motivation arises from an intellectual recognition of
                  the moral law which then generates a particular kind of
                  /feeling/ which is consequent to the intial intellectual
                  recognition

  
[fn:12] even though respect is a feeling, it is not one /received/ by
        influence, but one /self-wrought/ by a rational concept and
        therefore specifically different from all feelings of the former
        kind, which come down to inclination or fear. What I recognize
        immediately as a law for myself I recognize with respect, which
        signifies merely the consciousness of the /subordination/ of my
        will to a law, without mediation of other influences on my
        sense. The immediate determination of the will by the law and
        the consciousness of this is called /respect/, so that it is
        viewed as the /effect/ of the law on the subject and not as its
        /cause/. (4: 402, note)

[fn:13] Intellectualists hold that respect for the moral law is, or
        arises from, a purely intellectual recognition of the supreme
        authority of the moral law, and that this intellectual
        recognition is sufficient to generate moral action independently
        of any special motivating feelings or affections. Op- posed to
        the intellectualist interpretation is what I shall call the
        affectivist view. Affectivists need not deny that Kantian moral
        motivation initially arises from an intellectual recognition of
        the moral law. Contrary to intellectualists, how- ever, they
        maintain that it also depends on a peculiar moral feeling of
        respect for law, one consequent to the initial recognition or
        moral judgment the intellectualists emphasize exclusively.

*** Conformity to a Law: Potter's Analysis

1) A good will only has absolute worth.
   - (1a) Moral value always outweighs any other kind of value.
2) A good will is not good because of what it effects or accomplishes.
   (G, 394)
3) A human action is morally good if and only if it is done from duty.
   (G, 397-399)
4) To act from duty is to act, not with regard to the purpose to be
   attained by our action, but with regard only to the maxim in
   accordance with which it is decided upon.
   - (4a) The moral value of an action derives from a quality of its /maxim/.
   - (4b) Action from duty is action done on the basis of a maxim which
     we have adopted, not because its adoption will fulfill desires of
     ours, but because of its form.
5) This formal principle of volition (i.e., the principle of the
   adoption of maxims in virtue of their form) is simply the requirement
   that my action conform to universal law as such.
6) The essence of law is its universality.
7) Hence the moral law commands nothing but that I always act in such a
   way that I can will my that maxim should become a universal law.
8) To act for the sake of duty is to act only on that maxim which can at
   the same time be willed as a universal law.
9) $\therefore$ A good will is a will which always acts only on that
   maxim which can at the same time be willed as a universal law.

- Living things act in accordance with inner states --
  representations[fn:4]
- All /intentional action/ (as contrasted with bodily movement/behavior)
  is based on both a cognitive and a conative component[fn:6][fn:7]

  - Conative states are themselves either representational or
    non-representational

    - Feelings of pleasure/displeasure (non-representational)
    - Desire (representational)

- An intentional action requires the following causal chain: cognition
  $\rightarrow$ conation (feeling + desire) $\rightarrow$ action
- At the empirical 'level' we are (as are all living beings)
  psychologically determined[fn:15]

**** Maxims
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: maxims
   :END:

- What is a 'maxim'?[fn:10]

  - A 'subjective principle of willing' or principle on which a person
    acts

    - Contrasts with objective /law/[fn:8]

  - Designates an action to be performed in a type of situation and for
    some purpose

- Distinguish between:[fn:9]

  1) I will knock Alex down, in order to remove him from the path of an
     oncoming bullet.
  2) I will knock Alex down, in order to relieve my temper.
  3) I will punch a punching bag, in order to relieve my temper.

  - (A) is (at least) permissible while (B) is wrong, but not simply
    because of the action
  - (C) is permissible, but not simply because of the intention
  - What matters is the relation between action and intention -- viz.
    the 'form' of the maxim

- Kant's examples of maxims

  - let no insult pass unavenged (5:19)
  - when I believe myself to be in need of money I shall borrow money
    and promise to repay it, even though I know that this will never
    happen (4:422).

- Action from a maxim contrasts with merely acting from inclination
- Non-rational beings lack the capacity to act on maxims, so their
  actions (or behaviour) is completely determined by their sensible
  impulses
  
**** Maxims & Incorporation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: maxims-incorporation
   :END:

- Intentional action depends on the ability of the agent to act
  rationally
- Rational action requires the adoption of a maxim in which a desire to
  bring about some end has been 'incorporated'[fn:12]

  - 'incorporation' talk leaves open whether desires determine choice or
    action by themselves

- The 'Incorporation Thesis'

  - Desires do /not/ determine rational choice/intentional action by
    themselves

    - There is a question here whether intentional action is a status an
      agent /confers/ on her (possibility psychologically determined)
      actions via rational reflection/endorsement, or something she can
      /recognize/ her actions as having, given her capacity for freedom
      (what Kant calls 'practical freedom')[fn:16]

  - A desire, once incorporated, stands as a reason for the subject's
    action
  - The adoption of the maxim is not itself either causally connected to
    or otherwise a causal consequence of the (state of) desire, but is
    rather a 'spontaneous' and free act of the agent[fn:17]

- Status of the incorporation thesis is controversial

  - The original context of the claim concerns moral 'rigorism' -- that
    a subject is either good or evil, there is no intermediate position

    - Suggests that, contra the Incorporation thesis, desire acts as a
      sufficient incentive to action and that Kant's point concerns the
      possibility of freely choosing /which incentives/ will determine a
      subject's choices throughout her experience

**** The Will & Imperatives
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-will-imperatives
   :END:

- Distinguish between:[fn:30]

  - Action in accordance with a law (as is the case with all activity in
    nature)
  - Action in virtue of the /representation of a law/ (as is a case with
    a will governed by rational 'principles')

- Practical Reason (the Will [/der Wille/]): :: the capacity to act in
  accordance with, or as a result of, one's representation of a law;
  i.e. act according to principles

- Kant is addressing the issue of a will /in general/, so the laws in
  question are /objective/ laws, not /subjective/ maxims
- The will is a /capacity/, and as such exists even when not exercised,
  or exercised appropriately (i.e. in conformity with a law)
- Two kinds of will

  - Holy will: a will which /always/ acts in conformity with
    reason/rational law
  - Finite (human) will: a will exposed to subjective and non-rational
    (sensible) incentives

    - Only finite wills have imperatives which apply to them[fn:31]

- Imperatives are principles (representations of laws) which have
  normative force for an agent

  - In what sense 'normative force'?

    - phenomenological (feeling of compulsion)
    - favoring/representing as good (4:413)

- Hypothetical Imperative: :: command to do something whose value is
  conditioned by its status as a means to some further end, which is
  also willed

- In virtue of willing some end, it is /analytic/ that one wills the
  means to that end[fn:32]

- Categorical Imperative: :: command to do something whose value is
  unconditioned -- i.e. whose value is an end in itself

- A categorical imperative is synthetic a priori since it commands
  something new, something not entailed by the ends the agent wishes to
  pursue[fn:33]

\newthought{Objection:} There are non-moral oughts which are not
straightforwardly hypothetical

- e.g. 'Answer an invitation in the third person in the third person'

  - An imperative of etiquette is unconditional -- it does not apply
    only to those who have the end of (or an end that is served by)
    being polite

- But imperatives of etiquette do not apply with the requisite
  /universality/ which Kant has in mind -- they do not apply merely in
  virtue of the subject's status as a rational being

- The moral law, categorical imperative, and the universalization
  procedure are three distinct things

  - The moral law is (or specifies) a principle that applies to all

    God
  - The categorical imperative is a command to act in accordance to the
    moral law, and applies only to finite beings (e.g. humans). - The

    may or may not conform
  - Universalization is the procedure by which we examine our maxims
    with regard to their conformity with the moral law

- The first version of the CI and its variant concern the /form/ of
  willing
- The second version of the CI concerns the /matter/ of what is willed,

**** Kinds of Duty
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: kinds-of-duty
   :END:

- /Division/ (not /derivation/) of duties follows from the
  universalization procedure[fn:39]

- Perfect duty: :: One ought always (or never) do /x/
- Imperfect duty: :: One ought to do /x/ sometimes, and to some
  extent[fn:40]

- Violation of a perfect duty would generate a contradiction in
  /conception/
- Violation of an imperfect duty would generate a contradiction in
  /will/ but not in /conception/

[fn:39] It is easy to see that the first [contradiction in conception]
        conflicts with strict or narrower (unrelenting) duty, the second
        [contradiction in will] only with wider (meritorious) duty, and
        thus that all duties, as far as the kind of obligation (not the
        object of their action) is concerned, have by these examples
        been set out completely in their dependence on the one
        principle. (4:424)

[fn:40] if the law can prescribe only the maxim of actions, not actions
        themselves, this is a sign that it leaves a playroom
        (/latitudo/) for free choice in following (complying with) the
        law, that is, that the law cannot specify precisely in what way
        one is to act and how much one is to do by the action for an end
        that is also a duty. ... The wider the duty, therefore, the more
        imperfect is a man's obligation to action; as he, nevertheless,
        brings closer to /narrow/ duty (duties of right) the maxim of
        complying with wide duty (in his disposition), so much the more
        perfect is his virtuous action. (DV 6:390)

*** The Formula of Humanity

  - Could Kant's moral theory as expressed by FH justify a form of
    consequentialism?

    - Evaluate actions as good/right that promote or optimize the
      existence of rational nature

*** Autonomy & Heteronomy
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: autonomy-heteronomy
  :END:

- Two notions of 'autonomy'

  - Autonomy as a /property/ of the will[fn:41]
  - Autonomy as a /principle/ of the will[fn:42]

- All rival ethical theories place the principle of morality in some
  source other than (the structure of) the will -- they are
  'heteronomous' for that reason[fn:43]

[fn:41] Autonomy of the will is the characteristic of the will by which
        it is a law to itself (independent of any characteristic of the
        objects of willing). (4:440)

[fn:42] The principle of autonomy is thus: not to choose in any other
        way than that the maxims of one's choice are also comprised as
        universal law in the same willing. That this practical rule is
        an imperative...cannot be proved by mere analysis of the
        concepts that occur in it, because it is a synthetic
        proposition; one would have to go beyond the cognition of
        objects to a critique of the subject, i.e. of pure practical
        reason, since this synthetic proposition, which commands
        apodictically, must be capable of being cognized completely a
        priori (4:440)

[fn:43] If it is /in anything other/ than the fitness of its maxims for
        its own universal legislation, hence if - as it goes beyond
        itself - it is in a characteristic of any of its objects that
        the will seeks the law that is to determine it, the outcome is
        always /heteronomy/. (4:441)

[fn:1] See @timmermann2007, xxxi.

[fn:4] The faculty of a being to act in accordance with its
       representations is called /life/ (MM 6:211).

[fn:5] Insofar as a mental state ("representation") is the cause of an
       action that brings about some state of affairs, it is a desire:
       "the faculty of the soul for becoming cause of the actuality of
       the object through the representation of the object itself = ...
       the faculty of desire" (29:1012; see also 6:211, 399; 7:251). As
       this definition suggests, "action" occurs whenever a
       representation is the cause of the actuality of an "object,"
       where "object" includes physical objects but also states of
       affairs. (@frierson2014, 54-5)

[fn:6] Pleasure precedes the faculty of desire, and the cognitive
       faculty precedes pleasure ... . [W]e can desire or abhor nothing
       which is not based on pleasure or displeasure. For that which
       give me no pleasure, I also do not want. Thus pleasure or
       displeasure precedes desire or abhorrence. But still I must first
       cognize what I desire, likewise what gives me pleasure or
       displeasure; accordingly, both are based on the cognitive
       faculty. (29:877-8)

[fn:7] if we could investigate all the appearances of his power of
       choice down to their basis, then there would be no human action
       that we could not predict with certainty, and recognize as
       necessary given its preceding conditions. Thus in regard to this
       empirical character there is no freedom...(A549-50/B577-8;
       cf. CPrR 5:99; Pr 4:295)

[fn:8] A /maxim/ is the subjective principle of willing; the objective
       principle (i.e., the one that would also subjectively serve all
       rational beings as the practical principle if reason had complete
       control over the desiderative faculty) is the practical /law/.
       (4:400, note)

[fn:9] The former [a maxim] contains the practical rule determined by
       reason conformably with the conditions of the subject (often his
       ignorance or also his inclinations), and is therefore the
       principle in accordance with which the subject /acts/; but the
       law is the objective principle valid for every rational being,
       and the principle in accordance with which /he ought to act/,
       i.e., an imperative. (4:421, note)

[fn:10] @korsgaard1989, 339-40

[fn:11] [F]reedom of the power of choice [/Willkür/] has the
       characteristic, entirely peculiar to it, that it cannot be
       determined to action through any incentive /except so far as the
       human being has incorporated it into his maxim/ (has made it into
       the universal rule for himself, according to which he wills to
       conduct himself): only in this way can an incentive, whatever it
       may be, coexist with the absolute spontaneity of the power of
       choice of freedom). (RGV 6: 24; 73)

[fn:12] *Freedom in the practical sense* is the independence of the
        power of choice from *necessitation* by impulses of
        sensibility...in the human being there is a faculty of
        determining oneself from oneself, independently of necessitation
        by sensible impulses. (A534/B562)

[fn:15] Kant uses the term 'incentive' (/Triebfeder/) to describe the
        relation of the free person to the candidate reasons among which
        she chooses. An incentive is something that makes an action
        interesting to you, that makes it a live option. Desires and
        inclinations are incentives; so is respect for the moral law. An
        inclination by itself is merely an incentive, and does not
        become a reason for action until the person has adopted it
        freely into her maxim (@korsgaard1996a, 165)

[fn:16] Everything in nature works in accordance with laws. Only a
        rational being has the capacity to act /in accordance with the
        representation/ of laws, that is, in accordance with principles,
        or has a /will/. Since /reason/ is required for the derivation
        of actions from laws, the will is nothing other than practical
        reason. (4:412)

[fn:17] The representation of an objective principle in so far as it is
        necessitating for a will is called a command (of reason), and
        the formula of the command is called IMPERATIVE. All imperatives
        are expressed by an /ought/, and by this indicate the relation
        of an objective law of reason to a will that according to its
        subjective constitution is not necessarily determined by it (a
        necessitation). (4:413)

- Aims to show that the moral law, understood as a categorical
  imperative, is objectively valid for the human will

  - Proof of the objective validity of the moral law depends on proof of
    the transcendental freedom of the human will

    - Worry arises concerning a vicious circle---viz. that our knowledge
      of the moral law depends on knowledge of freedom and vice versa

  - Proof of the objective validity of the moral law, together with the
    claim (argued in GI-II) that if there is practical spontaneity
    (efficacious rational willing) then it must have a law, and that is

1.  A (human) will is 'a kind of causality that living beings have so
    far as they are rational' [definition]
2.  Freedom of the will, understood negatively, is practical freedom, or
    the ability 'to be active independently of alien causes determining'
    the will [definition]
3.  Freedom of the will, understood positively, is /autonomy/, or 'the
    property that a will has of being a law to itself' [definition]
4.  Negative freedom depends on positive freedom, so a person possesses
    practical freedom in virtue of their being autonomous [premise]
5.  An autonomous will necessarily has the categorical imperative as its
    practical principle or fundamental standard of (rational) choice
    [premise]
6.  The categorical imperative states the fundamental principle of
    morality [premise]
7.  $\therefore$ An autonomous (free) will and a good will (a will which
    chooses according to morality's dictates) are identical

    - A (rational) agent is moral if and only if it is free

8.  All rational agents are free
9.  $\therefore$ All rational agents are subject to (and thus motivated
    by) the moral law
10. $\therefore$ The moral law is objectively valid

- Kant takes premises (1) - (3) and (5) - (7) to have been demonstrated

4) Negative freedom depends on positive freedom, so a person possesses

  - The intelligibility of nature depends on lawful causation
    (necessitation of one event by a previous event)

    - Rational choice cannot be construed in terms of natural causation,
      since this would be a 'heteronomy of efficient causes' (4:446)

  - The intelligibility of rational choice depends on a lawful relation
    between desire and choice that is not (though is compatible with)
    natural law

    - Why suppose that the CI is the necessary law -- couldn't the
      hypothetical imperative supply the requisite intelligibility?
    - Kant seems to assume that a free will could not be one which is
      saddled with inclinations, only some of which it endorses as
      choice worthy -- instead a free will must be a will that is not
      determined by /any/ inclination that is not itself produced by the

- The Circle: :: 

  1) The ground for our believing we are subject to the moral law is our
     knowledge that we are free; (2) our knowledge that we are free is
     based on the presumption that we are subject to the moral
     law\footnote[][-1.25in]{a kind of circle comes to light here from which, as it seems, there is no way to escape. We take ourselves as free in the order of efficient causes in order to think ourselves under moral laws in the order of ends; and we afterwards think ourselves as subject to these laws because we have ascribed to ourselves freedom of will: for, freedom and the will's own lawgiving are both autonomy and hence reciprocal concepts, and for this very reason one cannot be used to explain the other or to furnish a ground for it but can at most be used only for the logical purpose of reducing apparently different representations of the same object to one single concept (as different fractions of equal value are reduced to their lowest expression).

**** Breaking the Circle
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: breaking-the-circle
   :END:

- We break out of the circle by appealing to the spontaneity of
  theoretical reason[fn:7]

  - Theoretical reason (or theoretical judgment) is an activity of
    reason in accordance with rational principles (e.g. principles of
    logic; an 'ethics' of belief)
  - Reasoning in accordance with rational principles cannot be
    ultimately determined by preceding events[fn:15]

- Explanation of the spontaneity of theoretical reason requires positing
  ourselves as 'intelligible objects' -- i.e. subjects of a realm free
  of natural (temporally structured) causation[fn:10]

1. The spontaneity of theoretical reason requires us to think of
   ourselves as not merely empirical but also intelligible objects
2. An intelligible reasoner cannot think of the causality of its own
   will except under the idea of freedom (defined negatively as
   'independence from the determining causes of the world of sense').
3. A causality of freedom is one according to the moral law (4:447)
4. $\therefore$ Understanding ourselves as intelligible reasoners, and
   thus as free, requires understanding ourselves as subject to the
   moral law[fn:8]

\newthought{Objections:}

- There is a gap between premises (1) and (2)

  - Even if we grant both that we are reasoners and that reasoning
    entails being transcendentally free (i.e. being a member of an
    intelligible realm operating according to laws of reason rather than
    natural causality), still it does not follow that we are /practical/
    reasoners with rational /wills/

    - We cannot act except under the assumption that we are capable of
      rationally choice

- Premise (1) is also problematic

  - If we cannot infer (e.g.) that there is a substantial self grounding
    the 'I think', how could we infer any other metaphysical conclusion
    about the self, such as that it is transcendentally free, based on
    appeals concerning the nature of (empirical) reasoning?

[fn:4] Since the concept of causality brings with it that of laws in
       accordance with which, by something that we call a cause,
       something else, namely an effect, must be posited, so freedom,
       although it is not a property of the will in accordance with
       natural laws, is not for that reason lawless but must instead be
       a causality in accordance with immutable laws but of a special
       kind; for otherwise a free will would be an absurdity (4:446)

[fn:5] I say now: every being that cannot act otherwise than /under the
       idea of freedom/ is just because of that really free in a
       practical respect, that is, all laws that are inseparably bound
       up with freedom hold for him just as if his will had been validly
       pronounced free also in itself and in theoretical philosophy. Now
       I assert that to every rational being having a will we must
       necessarily lend the idea of freedom also, under which alone he
       acts. Reason must regard itself as the author of its principles
       independently of alien influences; consequently...the will of a
       rational being cannot be a will of his own except under the idea
       of freedom, and such a will must in a practical respect thus be
       attributed to every rational being. (4:448)

[fn:6] All of our actions and those of other beings are necessitated,
       the understanding (and the will, insofar as it can be determined
       by the understanding) alone is free and a pure self-activity,
       which is not determined by anything other than itself. Without
       this original and inalterable spontaneity we would not cognize
       anything a priori, and our thoughts themselves would stand under
       empirical laws. The capacity to think a priori and to act is the
       unique condition of the possibility of the origin of all other
       appearances. The ought would also have no significance at all. (R
       5441 (1776-8), 18:182-3)

[fn:7] [O]ne cannot possibly think of a reason that would consciously
       receive direction from any other quarter with respect to its
       judgments, since the subject would then attribute the
       determination of his judgment not to his reason but to an
       impulse. (4:448)

[fn:8] Now, a human being really finds in himself a capacity by which he
       distinguishes himself from all other things, even from himself
       insofar as he is affected by objects, and that is reason. ...
       [R]eason...shows in what we call "ideas" a spontaneity so pure
       that it thereby goes far beyond anything that sensibility can
       ever afford it. ... Because of this a rational being must regard
       himself as intelligence (hence not from the side of his lower
       powers) as belonging not to the world of sense but to the world
       of understanding. ... As a rational being, and thus as a being
       belonging to the intelligible world, the human being can never
       think of the causality of his own will otherwise than under the
       idea of freedom' (4:452).

[fn:9] As a rational being, and thus as a being belonging to the
       intelligible world, the human being can never think of the
       causality of his own will otherwise than under the idea of
       freedom; for, independence from the determining causes of the
       world of sense (which reason must always ascribe to itself) is
       freedom. With the idea of freedom the concept of /autonomy/ is
       now inseparably combined, and with the concept of autonomy the
       universal principle of morality, which in idea is the ground of
       all actions of /rational beings/, just as the law of nature is
       the ground of all appearances. (4:452-3)

- Standard interpretation is that the argument concerns individuation or

  - Problem: Kant thinks we can conceptually individuate one object from
    another, intuition isn't necessary, though it is sufficient
- Warren's interpretation: Any representation of a spatial relation (e.g.
  "distant from") presupposes a representation of the space in which that
  relation is or could obtain. This differs from other kinds of representation
  of relations (e.g. "brighter than"), which don't require or presuppose the
  representation of some "space" (e.g. the "brightness line" constituting a
  one-dimensional "brightness space") in which those relations obtain.
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  what is crucial to bear in mind here is that the notion of a brightness-line
  is formed from an independently available concept, that is, the relational
  concept "brighter than." In order to form and apply this concept we need not
  presuppose any representation of a brightness-line. In order to represent
  one object as brighter than another, we do not need to represent, in
  addition, something that is different from these objects, namely, regions of
  brightness-space, which these objects are regarded as occupying. (warren 201)

**** First worry
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
although it seems that space is a presupposition that underlies our spatial thinking and experience, this does not necessitate that it comes from the mind’s conditioning, as it could be the case that the structure of reality itself has imposed itself on us
#+END_QUOTE

This is a classic worry, sometimes called the "neglected altertive". In other words, why not think that we both have to represent objects distinct from us as being in space /and/ that distinct objects /really are/ in space? If Kant is inferring from a fact about how we have to represent things to some fact as to how reality is really structured, it seems like we have the makings of a bad inference. 

There are two considerations that might help Kant out here. First, he defines intuition as a relational state that depends on the presence of its object. In the 1783 /Prolegomena/ he says

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
How is it possible to intuit something a priori? An intuition is a representation of the sort which would depend immediately on the presence of an object. It therefore seems impossible originally to  intuit a priori, since then the intuition would have to occur without an object being present, either previously or now, to which it could refer, and so it could not be an intuition. (4:481-2)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's inference would then be something like: we have a priori intuitions of space; we couldn't have such intuition if space were an independently existing thing; so space is just the most formal feature of all we intuit and not some independent thing.

A second consideration is that Kant thinks we know necessary truths about (euclidean) geometry. If space were as the neglected alternative suggests then we could not move from cognition or knowledge of how things are in our representation of space to how things are with space itself. But then we wouldn't have cognition or knowledge of necessary truths. But, Kant thinks, we /do/ have such cognition/knowledge. So space must just be a feature of our apprehension of things and not some independently existing thing itself.  

**** Second Worry
We shouldn't "conflate the thinkability of spatiality, with the actual experience of spatiality" or more broadly, that we shouldn't jump from "thinkability to possibility, and ‘what is thinkable’ to ‘what actually is and could be’." 

Indeed, Kant agrees with this. One might worry that this undermines his view that space is the form that all our outer intuitions must take (i.e. they all intuit spatial objects). But Kant thinks this is a contingent fact about us. Perhaps we could have had some other form of sensibility. He entertains the possibility of such other forms at the end of the Aesthetic (B72). 

Much of the rest of Kant's discussion of space (and time) proceeds in what we can call a "regressive" way. How must (the representation of) space be to explain how we have the kind of cognition and knowledge of it (e.g in geometry) that we do? 

*** Vy Doan
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Could it be that he was saying: Sensibility and intuition direct us to the object that needed to be analyze and allow us to take information from that object; then thought allows us to sort through the empirical data and looks for a definition of the object?
#+END_QUOTE
Yes - this definitely captures one aspect of Kant's thinking about the relation between intuition and concept (and thought). 

Kant calls intuition "representation which can be given prior to all thinking" (B132) and Kant famously says that conceptual thought without intuition is "empty" while intuition without the capacity for conceptual thought is "blind" (A51/B75). What exactly he means by this is something we'll discuss further. 

*** Cale Harms

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Why is it not possible for Kant to have both some conception of space, while also there being the intuition of Space? 
#+END_QUOTE

In fact Kant agrees that this is possible. He agrees that we have a concept of space and can also think of individual spaces. What he is concerned to deny is the position that these concepts are the most fundamental mode in which we represent space or spaces.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[intuition] is much stronger than a “gut feeling”. Instead his intuition is a sort of “flash” of knowledge that it beyond doubt, or something we could not conceive of without.
#+END_QUOTE

Right - intuition, for Kant, is not a kind of feeling, in the way that we tend in English to say things like, "I had a weird intuition that you would be here", etc. Intuitions also aren't knowledge, or at least, aren't knowledge of the propositional kind. The are close to what Bertrand Russell called "knowledge by acquaintance." They are non-propositional conscious apprehensions of things in space or in time.  

*** Samuel Hobbs
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The last paragraph of Kant’s opening remarks concerning the science of transcendental aesthetic, Kant lays forth his methodological principles
#+END_QUOTE

I'm not sure which paragraph is meant - perhaps the one at A22/B36?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This principles involve, so it seems to me, a principle which Hume also accepted. This principle says, basically, whatever is separable and distinguishable at all, is, at least in principle, separable and distinguishable in thought.
#+END_QUOTE

Kant mentions first "isolating" sensibility from understanding and then second, "detaching" from sensibility everything that belongs to sensation. There's a question as what warrants these two moves, but I don't see Kant appealing to the principle you mention. Indeed, and as we'll see, it seems plausible that Kant rejects the general principle. 

But this /does/ raise the issue of why Kant thinks we have some special access to "sensibility" or to faculties of the mind more generally. He might think that in the case of our own mental faculties, to the extent that they differ, we can think of, or more broadly represent, these differences. What warrants /that/ claim? That's a difficult issue, and one we should keep an eye on as we progress through the book. 


*** Tate Kollar
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 By a priori Kant means that it is not learned through experience.
#+END_QUOTE

Well, he means at least that, though there may be more to being a priori as well.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
By intuition I take Kant to mean that our cognition relates directly to a real object
#+END_QUOTE

Yes, as I mentioned above in discussion of Steve's question, Kant construes intuition as relating to some present entity. It's controversial what this is supposed to mean. Must the entity exist? Can it be present in some other sense? It's clear that Kant thinks we have an intuition of space (and time), and that neither space nor time "exist" in the manner that we or other objects in space and time do. So we'll try and sort out how this position could work. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Nonetheless, I still must conceive of all three of these images as outside of myself; I cannot understand the things I see (whether real or not) as part of myself.
#+END_QUOTE

It is possible that Kant is making a kind of conceivability claim in the first two arguments of the Metaphysical Exposition. And he seems to make an appeal conceivability at B5 and in a related way to imagination at A20-1/B35. We'll talk about this more tomorrow.

*** Antony Larrick
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We can intuitively know rain if we see it, but we cannot possess rain. We can catch raindrops, but once we catch and collect raindrops they are no longer raindrops, it simply becomes collected water. This seems like an intuitive concept of a transcendental object.
#+END_QUOTE

Kant uses the rain/rainbow example to illustrate an important element of his idealism---viz. the difference between an appearance and a thing as it is in itself. The empirical world (i.e. the world of possible experience) is such that "rainbows" are not independent existing things, but merely the appearance of raindrops under certain conditions. But Kant, in idealizing space, wants to push things further:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
not only these drops are mere appearances, but even their round form, indeed even the space through which they fall are nothing in themselves, but only mere modifications or foundations of our sensible intuition; the transcendental object,' however, remains unknown to us. (A46/B63)
#+END_QUOTE

Now the raindrops themselves (and all empirical objects more generally) are considered as mere appearances, and the thing as it is in itself is some unknown entity that Kant calls here the "transcendental object." 

*** Isabel Reynolds
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I don’t understand how spatial representation isn’t conceptual. 
#+END_QUOTE

Kant agrees that we can represent space conceptually. The question is whether our most /fundamental/ representation of space is conceptual. This is what the first two arguments of the Metaphysical Exposition are trying to argue against.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
And if it’s intuitive, how is it not sensory?
#+END_QUOTE

If by "sensory" one means, having sensation present, then Kant presents some seemingly conceivability type arguments to motivate the view that there is a non-sensational element or "form" to our experience. If by "sensory" one means, more broadly, having to do with the faculty of "sensibility" (as Kant calls it) then the pure intuitions are "sensory" in that sense. But Kant typically uses "sensory" in the former sense, as having to do with sensation. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I feel as if I have a mental concept of inﬁnite space even though I have no idea how much space that actually is. Or is space intuitive because I can’t fathom the speciﬁcs of space(representation of inﬁnite space) ?
#+END_QUOTE

In the 4th argument of the ME Kant has a very specific picture in mind of what conceptual thought is and why it would be impossible to acquire or possess a fundamental representation of space as an "infiinte given magnitude" if we had only conceptual resources to draw upon. We'll talk about this more tomorrow, but the basic idea is that our representation of space cannot be fundamentally conceptual, for if it were, we would need to grasp the totality of conceptual parts that constitute its content or "intension". Since this would mean grasping an infinite set of concepts (conceptual representations of each individual space or location), it would be psychologically impossible for any finite being. But Kant asserts that we /do/ have such a representation (of course, one might deny this point...). Hence, space is not something originally grasped conceptually.

*** Jeffrey Schade
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It seems to be a plausible argument that Kant moved this section [i.e. the Transcendental Exposition] from the Metaphysical Exposition to its own section because it reversed the prevailing methodology of the Critique in order to make the same argument as the ME, and this may have disrupted the flow of the argument and been confusing. In other words, it is a parallel or alternative argument to the same conclusion. This seems to me to be a plausible reason to accept the common interpretation of the TE. Kant reversed his methodology in the TE to provide a supporting argument to the ME.
#+END_QUOTE

There seems to be at least two worries about the "analysis" reading. First, it doesn't explain /how/ the representation of space affords us a priori cognition of the unique subject matter of thee science of geometry. Second, if, as the analysis reading suggests, Kant's aim is to establish the ideality of space via appeal to our knowledge of geometry then, as P.F. Strawson put it, Kant's theory of geometry "is no longer tenable as a theory of 'the mathematics of space' and has no force to establish the thesis of transcendental idealism as regards space."

*** Zachariah Wrublewski

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I wonder what Kant must assert regarding the space that one represents when thinking of different possible worlds, for example. Essentially, I wonder whether Kant is tied to the idea that there is one singular space, per se, or merely that space (with all of the properties he asserts it has) is of one kind, such that it might be the case that the space represented in our considerations of non-actual possible worlds is, in some sense, a different space
#+END_QUOTE

When /thinking/ (i.e. conceptually representing) possible worlds, we might be able, on Kant's view, to represent them as spatially extended in ways such that the phrase "you can't get there from here" would really be true, but there would nevertheless be distinct spaces. 

I think this raises a good question as to how "represent" in "one can only represent a single space" (A24/B38) is to be interpreted. If "represent" means conceptually represent, then I think there is no contradiction in conceptually representing non-continguous spaces. So I think Kant means something like, there is no intuition we could have such that we could represent non-continguous or disjoint spaces. Such intuitive representation would presuppose, in his view, some further space in which the spaces were placed, located, or otherwise a part of.

How can we really hope to separate the ‘pure acts of thought’ from that which is empirical and aesthetic-- reliably, and indisputably?
#+END_QUOTE

Good question. Kant's method as to how these are derived is unclear. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If there are such categories that are so deep within us, that construct our very thoughts about the outside world- how can we possibly have confidence in this so-called understanding?
#+END_QUOTE

Remember, Kant is no skeptic. He thinks that we obviously have knowledge, and successful scientific knowledge at that. This is part of drawing the contrast with the poor state of metaphysics. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant claims his treatment of the Table of Categories are superior Aristotle’s because his version is based on the understanding (and is more systematic), rather than being empirical. However, how do we really know that Kant gets the Categories right, and how do we know that Aristotle’s was so imperfect?
#+END_QUOTE

It depends on whether one can take Kant seriously when he says

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This division [of the categories] is systematically generated from a common principle, namely the faculty for judging (which is the same as the faculty for thinking), and has not arisen rhapsodically from a haphazard search for pure concepts, of the completeness of which one could never be certain, since one would only infer it through induction, without reflecting that in this way one would never see why just these and not other concepts should inhabit the pure understanding. Aristotle's search for these fundamental concepts was an effort worthy of an acute man. But since he had no principle he rounded them up as he stumbled on them (A80-1/B106-7)
#+END_QUOTE

I think the articulation of the table of judgment and its justification is at best obscure, and the "derivation" of the categories from the forms of judgment is simply not present. Whether one /can/ so derive the categories from judgment is another matter. Maybe Kant really had a proof and just didn't bother to articulate it. In general I think it is the strategy that is interesting, rather than the particular form it takes here. But we'll talk about this more in class. 

*** Vy Doan
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant thinks relation between objects can be definition for objects. If so, then how can we know that a relation between several of the two types of objects are not merely correlation and not some direct relation? Does he think that we can have a true representation of objects?
#+END_QUOTE

Kant thinks we can make true judgments about empirical objects, as well as the a priori "objects" that are space and time. So we can judge that, e.g. "the cat is on the mat" is true, as well as that "no two lines enclose a space". Kant thinks that not only are these judgments true, but knowably so (at least, excluding extreme skeptical cases like Descartes's evil demon).

What Kant denies is that we could ever know that our judgments are true independent of any possible experience. How could I know from judgment alone that the cat is on the mat? Or that two lines do not enclose a space? All logic can tell me is whether the concepts I'm employing in such judgments are consistent with one another. But neither logic nor the concepts alone ensure that there is an object or objects that correspond to the judgment (remember, Kant talks of truth in terms of the "conformity" (/Übereinstimmung/) of a cognition with its object (A58/B82)). Among other things, intuition is supposed to play that role. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On page 210, Kant said “Transcendental logic […] has a manifold of sensibility that lies before it a priori, which the transcendental aesthetic has offered to it, in order to provide the pure concepts of the understanding with a matter, without which they would be without any content, thus completely empty.” It seems to me that to have a pure understanding of something, we would still have to depends on our intuition and senses. I’m not sure how we can arrive at pure understanding with just logic. 
#+END_QUOTE

When Kant talks of the "pure concepts of the understanding" he's talking about the categories. These are a priori concepts---they do not depend on experience. But Kant agrees that we could not acquire these concepts unless we had experience. This is the point of his claim at B1 of the Introduction that all cognition "begins with experience". Part of Kant's argument in the Metaphysical Deduction concerns how we should understand our acquisition of the categorial concepts. Kant's view seems to be that they are traced to the way in which our intellect functions in judging that something is thus and so. 

*** Cale Harms

#+END_QUOTE

Fortunately for Kant's overall project, I don't think he is very dependent on whether he has hit on just the right concepts. What he needs is an explanation of some set of fundamental and a priori concepts that plausibly serve to do metaphysics. He's given us a potential strategy by relying on the connection between logic, thought, and judgment. But the details are all going to be tendentious.

Kant thinks that infinity in no sense can be a unity, because unity and infinity are just categorically different.
#+END_QUOTE

Kant on infinitely is a super interesting and tough subject. So I'm not entirely confident of what I'm going to say next. I think that Kant thinks infinities can be unities---he thinks that space and time are infinite (we can only grasp this fact in intuition after all) /and/ he clearly thinks they are unities (there is just /one/ space and /one/ time). What Kant seems to be denying, and what I think you're picking up on, is the sense in which the (let's call it) /cognitive content/ of the concept <infinity> is the same as that of <unity>. One might reply, "sure---infinities are /big/ unities!". So what else is going on? 

Let me use geometry as an example. I'm going to draw on Kant's 1790 discussion of the mathematician Abraham Kästner. Kant thinks that we need to distinguish “the different use of the concept of infinity” in geometry and in metaphysics (20:420). Once we do so, we see that the potential infinities of geometrical construction presuppose the /actual/ infinity of metaphysical space (what Kant's discussing in the Metaphysical Exposition of Space). Kant thinks that (i) actual infinity is coherent if potential infinity is and (ii) geometry requires the representation of actual infinities (though it does not construct such quantities).  Kant writes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[T]hat a line can be extended into infinity means as much as: the space in which I describe the line is larger than any line that I may describe in it. Thus the geometer grounds the possibility of his problem [/Aufgabe/] of enlarging a space (of which there are many) into infinity upon the original representation of a unitary [/einigen/] infinite, subjectively given space. (Kästner, 20:420)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant grants here that geometrical constructions exhibit a merely potential infinity: all constructions are finite but can be made arbitrarily large or small.  But he argues that this potential infinity presupposes and is grounded in an actually infinite structure that we represent and within which the relevant constructions occur. So it looks like Kant thinks there are different kinds of infinities---actual and potential---and that the mathematician's construction of infinities in geometry or arithmetic relies on the actual infinities intuited as the unitary forms---space and time. 

But with respect to the sentence that first drew your interest, "If, on the contrary, we compare a singular judgment with a generally valid one...then the former relates to the latter as unity relates to infinity, and is therefore in itself essentially different from the latter"---I really don't know what to say (nor, for example, does Allison). Sounds like the start of a paper topic!

I am not sure how he could prove that there are no other forms of pure understanding besides those he cites.
#+END_QUOTE

I'm not sure either, but it seems like Kant needs to in order to prove his claim. But is this really possible? For example, how coherent is it to think of a being that acknowledges radically different logical principles (e.g. allows contradictions)? For Kant, such "logical aliens" are impossible. But it seems rather that they are just incomprehensible to us. 


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I would think that Kant would want that, as time goes on, we would learn more about how and what kind of pure understandings exist.
#+END_QUOTE

It sounds like you think we empirically discover logical principles. Kant denies this -- logic is a priori (it is marked by strict universality and necessity), so it can't be empirically derived (e.g. from doing psychological experiments, or a lot of truth tables or semantic tableaux). 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I am very confused on Kant's definition/concept of what a judgement is. He says, "Judgement is therefore the mediate cognition of an object, hence the representation of a representation of it." The representation of a representation part throws me off the most. As best I can understand, he is just referring to the fact that when we see objects, all we see are representations of them. In this case, my representation of an object (an object which in itself is just a representation) is what a judgement is. If this is what he means then it would mostly make sense, but if not then I am very confused. 
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's discussion of this is confusing! It is in fact not at all clear what the difference is between intuition and concept/judgment since it isn't at all clear what "immediacy" comes to here. But the basic idea seems to be something like -- intuition relates to an object without first relating to some other representation. So whatever it is that intuitions relate to when they relate to objects and thereby "give" them to the consciousness of a perceiving subject, Kant's view seems to be that they don't do this in virtue of /first/ being related to some further representation.

Now compare concepts (which are the constituents of judgments). Kant says that "a concept is...never immediately related to an object, but is always related to some other representation of it (whether that be an intuition or itself already a concept" (A68/B93). Take a concrete example, like the concept <red>. Kant thinks that when you employ <red> in a judgment, the concept itself doesn't give you any particular object. It just says "of all the objects there are or could be, some of them have a feature or property -- /red/". So Kant thinks that when you use the concept <red> you use lots of other concepts, like <object>, <property>, <color>, etc. So <red> relates first to all of these other concepts (you wouldn't count as understanding/having <red> if you didn't get that red is a color). In a judgment like "fire engines are red" Kant thinks you're just relating concepts together, but you haven't yet related those concepts to any particular object. To do so you need to rely on some actual or possible intuition (e.g. an intuition of a red fire engine).  

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Another thing that confused me was when Kant says that all of the categories are a dichotomy with the third being the combination of the two. 
#+END_QUOTE

This is a thing that confuses virtually everyone who has ever read the /Critique/. William and Martha Kneale, in their /The Development of Logic/, remark that "[t]he fact that he [Kant] is able to provide three species under each heading is obviously a matter of accident. For the species in any one set are not really co-ordinate, and there is no common principle requiring trichotomy" (pp. 355-56). I'm not convinced that they are wrong.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It also seems that the third category would not be pure since it is just the sum of two other forms of pure knowledge.
#+END_QUOTE

In this respect, at least, Kant is on good ground. To say that a concept is pure is just to say that it is free of any empirical content. So the "pure" categories do not derive their content from any sensory experience, but from the operation of the mind itself in judging. This is compatible with thinking that some of these concepts are derived from others, so long as none are derived from experience.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When he references the logical use of understanding does he mean the kind of logic that we use in math? 
#+END_QUOTE

Kant thinks of logic as articulating the principles by which the intellect (specifically understanding and reason) operates. So the principle of contradiction (\not(A & \not A)) and the various principles of inference familiar from basic logical syllogisms (e.g. All As are Bs, x is A, so x is B). We might /use/ logic in doing math, but math relies on intuition in a way that logic does not (e.g. math needs intuition for introducing the subject matter of math, such as geometric objects).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
From what I understand, a judgement is made up of many concepts, and those concepts, are representations? On the other hand, an intuition has a more direct relationship with representation (like time and space)? 
#+END_QUOTE

Yes, exactly. However, how we should understand this "immediate" relation that intuition has to its objects is somewhat unclear. We can talk about this more tomorrow. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Another question, the concept of bodies is a judgement and not an intuition because we relate bodies to other concepts but not to time and space? But bodies just exist and time in space? 
#+END_QUOTE

I'm not entirely sure what to say to this - maybe the question is prompted by one of the following texts:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In every judgment there is a concept that holds of many, and that among this many also comprehends a given representation, which is then related immediately to the object. So in the judgment, e.g., "*All bodies are divisible*,'" the concept of the divisible is related to various other concepts; among these, however, it is here particularly related to the concept of body, and this in turn is related to certain appearances that come before us. (A68-9/B93)
#+END_QUOTE

If this is the text prompting your question, then Kant's point is just whenever we make a judgment, we're relating concepts to one another, and in fact all concepts always relate to other concepts---there is no concept by means one which one can think of a /particular/ being (e.g. you or me). In order to think of particular beings we need intuition. But it is certainly compatible with Kant's point that he also think that we couldn't even /have/ the concept <body> if we didn't have experience of bodies, since the concept is empirical and thus relies on our having certain kinds of experiences (here Kant is in broad agreement with folks like Locke and Hume about empirical concept acquisition). 

Here's another related text:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Yet in regard to the merely logical use of the understanding it would remain undetermined which of these two concepts will be given the function of the subject and which will be given that of the predicate. For one can also say: " Something divisible is a body." Through the category of substance, however, if I bring the concept of a body under it, it is determined that its empirical intuition in experience must always be considered as subject, never as mere predicate; and likewise with all the other categories. (A94/B128-9)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's point here is that in a judgment like "a (or this) body is divisible" one does not thereby know whether or what the substantial being (i.e. the "thing") is that one is talking about. Kant thinks one could just as easily judge that "some divisible is a body". Which is the substance and which the predicate, the divisible, or the body? His claim is that the category of substance regulates this (See also Jeff Schade's question). How exactly it does this is another matter, one which we'll talk about tomorrow and when we get to the section of the /Critique/ called the Principles.

is it fair to judge Kant’s argument by the standards of general logic when the argument he is making is a transcendental one?
#+END_QUOTE

I'm not quite sure how to take this. Don't confuse "transcendental argument" (or "transcendental deduction") with "transcendental logic". Kant certainly did invent the name, and perhaps the concept, for this notion of a "logic", but he also largely determined, if not invented, the notion of logic as "formal". Rephrasing your question then, we should evaluate Kant's notion of transcendental logic differently than we do his pure general (or pure formal) logic, for the former concerns a relation to objects from which the latter abstracts away. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I was struck by how much harder Kant has to work in the transcendental deduction of the categories to show that the pure concepts of the understanding are a priori, as compared with the same argument in the Transcendental Aesthetic
#+END_QUOTE

Yes - Kant makes a fairly big deal of this in §13. To quote him:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The categories of the understanding, on the contrary, do not represent to us the conditions under which objects are given in intuition at all, hence objects can indeed appear to us without necessarily having to be related to functions of the understanding, and therefore without the understanding containing their /a priori/ conditions.  Thus a difficulty is revealed here that we did not encounter in the field of sensibility, namely how *subjective conditions of thinking* should have *objective validity* (A89-90/B122)
#+END_QUOTE 

If this difficulty is one Kant thinks he can resolve (which it surely is) then the question is how the Transcendental Deduction goes about accomplishing this. More on that next week.

Kant asserts that problematic propositions merely express logical possibility (as opposed to actuality or necessity), and he seems to mean something like “problematic propositions make assertions about posits that could be assumed, given the set of necessary propositions.” But, if this is the case, I’m not so certain why these sorts of propositions should be given as a sort that is separate from the Apodictic propositions, given that Kant seems to mean something like “doesn’t clash with necessary propositions.”
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's conception of a "problematic" judgment, or better, a "problematically held" judgment, is pretty close to what we would think of as "entertaining" a proposition. A judgment held as apodictic is necessary, and in the note Kant credits this to the faculty of reason in particular. He says, 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It is just as if in the first case thought were a function of the *understanding*, in the second of the *power of judgment*, and in the third of *reason*. This is a remark the elucidation of which can be expected only in the sequel. (A75/B100 note)
#+END_QUOTE

This is tied up with the way in which Kant conceives of the modality of judgment as contributing "nothing to the content of the judgment...but rather concerns only the value of the copula in relation to thinking in general." (A74/B100). This is going to correspond to the categories of modality. There are no genuine modal properties of reality as it is in itself, only modal properties as they relate to cognitive faculties. In the /Critique of Judgment/ Kant says,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It is absolutely necessary for the human understanding to distinguish between the possibility and the actuality of things. The reason for this lies in the subject and the nature of its cognitive faculties. For if two entirely heterogeneous elements were not required for the exercise of these faculties, understanding for concepts and sensible intuition for objects corresponding to them, then there would be no such distinction (between the possible and the actual). That is, if our understanding were intuitive, it would have no objects except what is actual. Concepts (which pertain merely to the possibility of an object) and sensible intuitions (which merely give us something, without thereby allowing us to cognize it as an object) would both disappear. Now, however, all of our distinction between the merely possible and the actual rests on the fact that the former signiﬁes only the position of the representation of a thing with respect to our concept and, in general, our faculty for thinking, while the latter signiﬁes the positing of the thing in itself (apart from this concept). c,9 Thus the distinction of possible from actual things is one that is merely subjectively valid for the human understanding, since we can always have something in our thoughts although it does not exist, or represent something as given even though we do not have any concept of it. The propositions, therefore, that things can be possible without being actual, and thus that there can be no inference at all from mere possibility to actuality, quite rightly hold for the human understanding without that proving that this distinction lies in the things themselves. (5:401-2)
#+END_QUOTE 

Kant then goes on to consider another kind of being (God)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I cannot presuppose that in every such being thinking and intuiting, hence the possibility and actuality of things, are two different conditions for the exercise of its cognitive faculties. For an understanding to which this distinction did not apply, all objects that I cognize would be (exist), and the possibility of some that did not exist, i.e., their contingency if they did exist, as well as the necessity that is to be distinguished from that, would not enter into the representation of such a being at all.

I still have a concern: Behind all this, I worry about how Kant seems to assume that “representations that make up experience are objectively valid”
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's project is in some ways conservative. It is certainly not skeptically motivated. He thinks we have empirical cognition, and ultimately knowledge, in a variety of areas, but especially physics and mathematics. This is part of how we are able to draw such a stark contrast with the sorry state of metaphysics. Kant wants an explanation of how such cognitions or "experience" is possible. He's not questioning that we have such experience---he wants to know how it is possible for us to have it.


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I remain concerned that there are some deep assumptions that affect the overall import of Kant’s work; namely, despite the effort to immunize us from the impurities from experience, how can we accomplish this if such a basic thing such as the validity of our objectivity, and their characteristic necessity and universality are simply assumed (at least regarding representations)?
#+END_QUOTE

It is necessary that red things are colored, that (in Euclidean geometry) two lines do not enclose a space, and that bodies are extended. Not only are these things necessary, but they are knowable so. What explains this?

Now, one might argue that we cannot know such truths until we have proved that we are not in a situation involving radical deception (e.g. Descartes's evil demon scenario). But this is controversial, to say the least. It might even be more controversial than claims like the kind mentioned above, which Kant seeks to explain (G.E. Moore, for example, thought this). 

Interestingly though, German philosophy subsequent to Kant took seriously the view that no genuine explanation of the possibility of cognition and knowledge in the cases with which Kant was concerned would be forthcoming without also being able to answer the skeptic. German idealists like Reinhold, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel (Hegel perhaps being the most concerned with skepticism) all tried to show how Kant's philosophy could be modified in ways that made it immune to skeptical worries. A good (if somewhat controversial) account of this is in Paul Franks' book /All or Nothing/.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One condition for cognition Kant talked about on page 252 is necessary unity. Necessary unity of the judgement isn’t that the two objects belong to each other in some way in the physical sense but that one is necessary in the cognition of the other. The problem with this is that it’s hard to know if one object is necessary to understand another or is it merely coincidental or correlational. 
#+END_QUOTE

There are a number of things going on the §19 passage you mention, and it isn't really clear all of the different ways in which Kant is thinking of "necessary unity." Let me try two though, and see if that helps. 

First, Kant simply assumes that there are some judgments that are true necessarily. He has in mind here judgments like "if x is red then x is colored" or "if x is a body then x is extended." Part of what §19 seeks to show is that association simply cannot account for this. All association can say is that whenever subjects have representations like "body" then those representations are associated with the representation "extended". But that doesn't capture what we pre-theoretically take to be the case---viz. that bodies /must/ be extended, otherwise they aren't bodies. 

A second thing, and related to the first, that Kant is trying to claim is that the /explanation/ of how this necessary connection between subject and predicate in a judgment could come about. They come about due to the "the necessary unity of the apperception" (B142). In other words, the concepts are related together in the way that they are because there is a self-conscious act that makes them so related.

Kant goes on to say that,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Only in this way does there arise from this relatione a *judgment*, i.e., a relation that is *objectively valid*, and that is sufficiently distinguished from the relation of these same representations in which there would be only subjective validity, e.g., in accordance with laws of association. (B142)
#+END_QUOTE

His point is that if we had only the materials offered by an associationist theory, we could never get beyond the purely subjective connections made by individual subjects. For example, you might associate the idea of body with heaviness, while I associate it with lightness. We're not even disagreeing here, since all that is being done is association. There isn't any /claim/ being made as to how things are independently of our subjective associations. Kant's position is that such claims to how things are independently of a particular subject's psychology---claims to objectivity---are only possible if there is something other than mere association happening. 

Now, you note a perfectly important issue---it isn't always easy to tell correlation apart from coincidence. True, but Kant would agree. But the issue he's after is a principled one---how could we ever make objective claims, claims going beyond our subjective associations, if associationism captured the extent of our psychology?

Part of me wants to question that we have such a unity or make the remark that such unity may just be partly produced by our mind. One prime example comes to mind of watching and hear a ball bounce. While the person bouncing the ball is close enough, when the ball hits the ground we hear the sound of the ball hitting the ground, but if the person bouncing the ball is far away we see the ball hit the ground and then hear a delayed sound.
#+END_QUOTE

Good question -- one thing that many of the readers of the Deduction note is that Kant's discussion of "unity" of representation of objects sounds a lot like a phenomenon cognitive scientists have been trying to explain for many years. This phenomenon typically goes by the name of "binding", where the idea is that our minds are capable of connecting or "binding" together information from different sense modalites as all stemming from /one/ object. Even in your (counter)example above, the experiencing subject presumably still experiences the sound, however delayed, as the sound /of the ball/. How is this possible? At least some folks have interpreted Kant as arguing that the senses themselves don't determine an answer to this -- instead there is something the mind /does/ to integrate the various information streams coming from each sense modality into a single unified experience of a particular object; in your example, a bouncing ball.

It seems to me that representation as such requires the unity of consciousness. 
#+END_QUOTE

This is often how Kant is taken as arguing (so that the argument of the TD is an argument concerning the possibility of purely subjective mental states counting as representations of something non-subjective) but I'm skeptical. One of the main reasons for my skepticism is that Kant holds that non-rational animals (i.e. non-human animals) lack an intellect. So they would be incapable of performing the activities requisite for generating a "unity of consciousness." However, Kant does /not/ deny that such animals have representations, and he is reported as allowing that they might have intuitions of objects. If Kant thought that representation relied on combinations made by the intellect then this is a possibility he should have denied to animals. We should talk about this tomorrow. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
one way to understand conceptual analysis is as being a set of dispositions to judge and make inferences. One way that this is “cashed out” (to use a colleague’s favored expression) is that conceptual analysis captures one’s dispositions to judge and make inference by providing a maximally consistent set of platitudes (concerning the relevant area)...This view seems to me to be one where analysis /precedes/ synthesis.
#+END_QUOTE 

This "Canberra style" view of conceptual analysis may well capture part of Kant's idea. But, if I'm understanding the position correctly, there also seems to be a clear analogue of Kant's claim that all analysis depends on a synthesis. For how could we get the armchair analysis going if we didn't already have a view of the "set of dispositions", and their corresponding platitudes, with which we were concerned? Kant's view is that the analysis of one into many depends on an "original" act of bringing many into one. It isn't clear to me that the view transfers as easily to mere dispositions as it does to consciousness of representations but this is also worth talking about. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant claims that the unity which is represented in the combination of representation in synthesis is represented in the combination but is not brought about by the combination, if I understand him correctly. The unity is brought about through the used categories in combination???
#+END_QUOTE

Kant thinks that an act of unifying representations is presupposed both by our representation of objects through a "manifold" of intuition, /and/ in our representation of ourselves as numerically identical across our thoughts (it is the /same/ 'I think' that can accompany all representation). This /act/ is called the "original synthetic unity of apperception". That act is also responsible for a representation---the "I think"---that must be able to accompany all represenations that count as /mine/. Kant doesn't always distinguish the two, i.e. he doesn't always distinguish between the /power/ or /capacity/ of original apperception and the /representation/---the "I think"---that is the expression of that power.  But he does clearly do so in the following passage:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“that self consciousness which, because it produces the representation *I think*, which must be able to accompany all others and which in all consciousness is one and the same, cannot be derived from any other” (B132)

Kant also says that analytical unity is only possible under the presupposition of some synthetic one. I think this means that he is presupposing an actual material world
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's usage of "analytic" and "synthetic" and related terms is tricky. Kant thinks of an analytical unity as the unity of one in many. Synthetic unity is the unity of many in one. Kant construes concepts as analytic unities (a single concept representing many possible objects that have the property represented by the concept -- e.g. <red> -- see the note at B133-4). Kant's point at B133-4 is that there is no analytic unity, no unity of one representation in many, unless there is a synthesis that brings this about -- i.e. an act of bringing many representations into one. With respect to the particular point Kant makes about self-consciousness let's look at the text:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
it is only because I can combine a manifold of given representations *in one consciousness* that it is possible for me to represent the *identity of the consciousness in these representations* itself, i.e., the *analytical* unity of apperception is only possible under the presupposition of some *synthetic* one. (B133)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's concern in §16 is with self-consciousness. So the "analytical unity of apperception" concerns the representation of the same 'I' in many representation---i.e. the representation of the numerical identity of the thinker across thoughts. The "synthetic unity of apperception" is, correspondingly, the representation of a multiplicity of representations as belonging to the same subject---the same 'I'. Hence, the claim that the analytical unity of apperception is only possible on the basis of a synthetic unity means that it is only insofar as the subject or 'I' uniﬁes its representations that it can become conscious of its own identity.

The idea of the intuition seems very similar if not the same to the Pure Apperception. Unless the intuition refers to an act of sensibility, rather than an act of cognition.

Kant talks about both the pure intuitions of space and time and categories as "forms" of cognition. So in that way they are similar. And both are contributions of the subject to cognition. But Kant thinks of the contributions of sensibility as "passive", while those of the intellect are "active" and "spontaneous." We'll talk more about this distinction and what these terms mean as the semester goes on. But one issue your questions raises concerns how independent the forms of sensibility really are from the intellect. Does it make sense to think the of the forms of intuition as possibly present in beings that lack an intellect (e.g. how Kant thinks of non-human animals)?

Well - the key claim is that the "I think" must /be able/ to accompany one's representations. So Kant is making a claim that a representation must be such that I could say (or think) of it that /I think it/, if that representation is to count as /mine/. Another way of putting this is to say that all my representations must be thinkable by me /as such/, and thus that I must be able to achieve a certain kind of self-consciousness with regard to my representations---I must be able to think of them as mine.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
but thinking prior to a representation is an intuition
#+END_QUOTE

What Kant says at B132 is "That representation that can be given prior to all thinking is called *intuition*." Here he is pointing out that intuiting isn't thinking, even though it is still representing. Since it is representing it is subject to the claim made in the first sentence of §16 concerning the "I think." So even intuition, though prior to all thinking, is subject to the possibility of being accompanied by the "I think" if it is to count as /my/ intuition. This is why Kant then says "Thus all manifold of intuition has a necessary relation to the I think in the same subject in which this manifold is to be encountered."

When you bring something about in space, like a line, it’s synthetically bringing about a manifold… There’s a given manifold and the combination of something in space with its manifold creates said line?

So Kant thinks that in having a cognition of a line, one represents a unity of spaces (i.e. the points constituting the line) as a single entity. In order to represent the space and the points constituting the line, we need to be able to intuit, so we need sensibility. But in order to represent what is given by sensibility /as a line/ we need the understanding, because we need to join together the represented spaces as one object---the line. So, for cognition of the line we need the faculties to cooperate. Sensibility represents the spaces, and the understanding (or intellect more generally) combines those representations of spaces into a representation of a single determinate entity.

Is S-experience the type of experience described by empiricists such as Hume and Locke, in which objects ground concepts?

#+END_QUOTE

This is really one of the long-standing and very vexing issues surrounding Kant's argument. Kant is notoriously sloppy in the way he uses terms, even those terms that he otherwise takes care to define. The difference between "simple" and "complex" experience that I discuss is just one way to try and make sense of various texts that otherwise don't obviously hang together. 

But one way in which I think Kant's argument has bite against British forms of empiricism is that they all also think there are complex experience. After all, folks like Locke, Berkeley, and Hume all think that we don't just have simple impressions of, e.g., colored points, but that we have a temporally structured experience of colored expanses, such that some are related to others in particular privileged ways. Hume, for example, might deny this, but then he is left with a question he seemingly can't answer---viz. what justifies the use of any concept of an object whatsoever? Since his answer, in the end, seem like it would have to be "nothing", one might think that Hume went wrong somewhere in his starting assumptions.

Am I misunderstanding Kant when I assume he means to say that the activities of the imagination are necessarily synthetic here (in the transcendental deduction), or am I misunderstanding his notion of “free play” in the third critique as non-synthetic (or both, or neither)?

Though we're mostly going to wait to discuss the imagination until next week ("step two" of the argument of the Deduction) it is worth making a point now in anticipation of that discussion. Recall that Kant thinks the "same function" (B104) is employed both in the synthesis of concepts in judgment and the synthesis of intuitions in perception. This is part of how Kant distinguishes between the logical use of the functions of the understanding (the forms of judgment) and the real use of the functions of the understanding (the categories with respect to intuition). But as Kant goes on to clarify in §24 the faculty that carries out the synthesis of intuition is the /imagination/. In general the imagination functions as a kind of "bridge" faculty, having some features Kant typically associates with the intellect and some features that he associates with sensibility. Whether this is coherent is something we'll discuss next week.

Answering this will depend on how you construe Kant's argument in the TD and especially §26.

If, however, one reads the TD as arguing only that categorial synthesis is necessary for "experience" or cognition, then rational beings have, along with babes and animals, intuitions of objects, though these might be organized in importantly different ways in rational beings.

At the end of section 24 Kant concludes that we cognize ourselves as appearance, not it in itself (B156). It didn’t seem clear to me what exactly Kant is referring to. Is ourselves supposed to mean our mind, body, consciousness, psychological self, or some combination.
#+END_QUOTE
Great question. Kant's view seems to be that we have cognition and knowledge of the various powers of the mind (e.g. it's ability to generate intuitions and to conceptualize them) but we lack any cognition or knowledge of what the subject is that has this mind. Kant is thus denying that we can have the kind of knowledge of ourselves as mental substances that Descartes and Leibniz argue for. More radically, Kant might be plausibly taken as arguing that the only cognition we have of ourselves is as embodied human beings, and not as purely mental or soul-like substances.

Even mathematics, which seems to be a paradigm of synthetic a priori understanding, must have empirical application. Our thinking must be accompanied by intuitions if this is to count as cognition.
#+END_QUOTE
Right. Though this isn't to say that mathematics might not exist as a rule-governed enterprise absent intuition of (empirical) objects. It would, however, be a kind of mere game, since space and time themselves do not exist, so a mathematics based merely on pure space and time would be a kind of game that had no direct application to reality (i.e. existing things).

If Kant is a verificationist, then it is unclear how he can still entertain the meaningful nature of various theological questions, as well as questions concerning our own nature as non-material beings. But Kant does entertain such questions, and spent a fair bit of time writing and lecturing on these matters. So it is unlikely that he thought such matters were /meaningless/ in the manner required by verificationism. But this is worth talking more about.

#+END_QUOTE
Yes -- Kant is often called a (or even /the/) synthesizer (no pun intended) of previous traditions or approaches in philosophy. Sometimes it is put much less charitable though, as in the following from Lorne Falkenstein:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant is often referred to as the 'great synthesizer.' The same point can be made, less charitably, by referring to him as the 'great coward.' ... Kant was not the sort of person who had the intellectual courage to face up to a dilemma and reject one alternative in favour of the other. Instead, when he felt himself pulled in opposite directions by conflicting imperatives, his preference was to try to work out some way of satisfying both.

Does a blind person have less representations of an object because they’re unable to see? If that’s the case, wouldn’t our representations of an object be different? I’m trying to think about this way, if I have 5 things that I represent in an object, and a blind person only has 4,  are we still representing the same thing? 
#+END_QUOTE
Interesting question. Though many of Kant's examples and discussions are vision-centric, he seems to think that the space represented visually and tactilely is the same space (remember the Transcendental Aesthetic's claim that there is but one space). So the blind person is representing the same feature of an object (is repulsive boundary in a spatial location) that the sighted person is able to represent visually. Bats can do this aurally. However, a creature that lacked senses of touch, vision, and hearing, as well as any relevant analogue, would plausibly, on Kant's view, lack any outer intuitions, and thus would be unable to represent outer objects.

is the insight I quoted a condition of the unity of apperception that we should understand to be itself an analytical or a synthetic one?
#+END_QUOTE
This is a really good question, and there is not an obvious answer. It also arises not just for the unity of apperception but for other seemingly synthetic a priori principles that Kant discusses (e.g. the distinction between sensibility and understanding, the principle of non-contradiction). The question is whether Kant needs to explain /all/ synthetic a priori claims or just some (i.e. those immediately necessary for the possibility of experience). If it is /all/ claims, then it isn't clear that his strategy for explaining those immediately relevant for the possibility of experience are apt---unity of apperception or the distinction between the faculties is not something whose explanation seemingly depends on the pure forms of intuition: space and time. So it may be that Kant only intended his explanation of the synthetic a priori to extend so far---i.e. only to experience itself.   

*** Zachariah Wrublewski
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
it’s still unclear to me how the imagination could be sketched as essentially performing synthesis, but also continuing to be importantly employed in a sort of “free play” with the understanding, which, presumably, doesn’t necessarily involve synthesis in any of the ways discussed in the Sellars piece
#+END_QUOTE
Though it is (unsurprisingly) debatable exactly what Kant's conception of the "free play" of the faculties comes to, it is compatible with a number of ways of treating that view that there is synthesis going on. The basic idea is that the imagination /tries/ to synthesize its object (the art object or the sublime) in a categorial manner but never quite succeeds. Nevertheless, this attempt to do so has a pleasurable result, and it is this pleasurable result that we experience as the (objective) enjoyment of beauty.

I am not clear how the “understanding is capable of being instructed and equipped through rules” and how can we know which rule/rules instruct the power of judgement (B172).

In a sense this is pretty straightforward. I can teach you the concepts <red> and <blue>, and then you can go and sort the red things from the blue things. But there is a somewhat myterious component to this, as Kant denies that we can ultimately understand one's ability to judge the red things from the blue things entirely in terms of rules. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
if [the understanding] wanted to show generally how one ought to subsume under these rules, i.e., distinguish whether something stands under them or not, this could not happen except once again through a rule. But just because this is a rule, it would demand another instruction for the power of judgment, and so it becomes clear that although the understanding is certainly capable of being instructed and equipped through rules, the power of judgment is a special talent that cannot be taught but only practiced.

What I’m confused about is that: is the schema purely intellectual? He said in B180 “The schema of the triangle can never exist anywhere except in thought”. 
#+END_QUOTE
Kant is confusing on this point, and it isn't clear what his considered position is. He says that "The schema is in itself always only a product of the imagination" (B179) but as you point out he also says that the schema exists "in thought" (B180). 

Perhaps the most straightforward way to reconcile these texts is to construe "thought" broadly as "in the mind." Kant is saying that unlike the intuition of a particular triangular object, the /schema/ for the representation of that triangle is merely a rule for organizing representations. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But if I am to not accept the schemata for the reason that there are no arguments to support them, then it would be easy to reject the schemata of the categories

Certainly it seems very open to the reader to object to Kant here---how exactly does time + a category yield the particular schematized categories that Kant describes?
*** Cale Harms
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I think it is best to start with generally considering the schema of a concept in general. The Wikipedia definition states that a schema “describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them”. One question is how far does Kant’s definition differ in his use of the word?
#+END_QUOTE
Somewhat surprisingly, the Wikipedia definition is not that far from Kant's usage. He clearly thinks of a schema as a way of organizing or marshaling information for use in thinking and perceiving. But a schema isn't a pattern of thought (that would be purely conceptual) nor pattern of behaviour (if by that is specifically meant some set of bodily movements) but a rule or method for organizing or generating sensory representations according to the content of a concept. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It is still not clear to me how the schemata applies or differs between this different kinds of concepts.
#+END_QUOTE
This is because Kant is unclear! This will be a central topic of discussion tomorrow. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I am also trying to understand how the Schematism fits into the rest of Kant’s project.
#+END_QUOTE 
Recall the way I've been presenting the order of questions in Kant's discussion:

  1. /Which/ concepts are a priori? (the Metaphysical Deduction)
  2. /Must/ the categories apply to objects of experience? (the
     Transcendental Deduction)
  3. /How/ could the categories apply to objects of experience? (the
     Schematism)
  4. /What/ synthetic a priori truths do we know as the result of their
     application? (the System of All Principles)

     
So Kant is trying to give us an explanation as to how the pure categories could apply to object of empirical intuition, given the radically different nature of the representational content involved.

For one thing, imagination (I can’t exactly recall whether Yablo uses the term) doesn’t necessarily correspond to imaging
#+END_QUOTE
Certainly this seems to be a big innovation of Kant's. The imagination doesn't just produce "images", it generates schemata by which images are produced. And what you say about the determinable/determinate relation is certainly one way to think about this.

A question of mine is whether this capacity of imagination which is “more the representation of a method” operates independently of appearance. If it can and does, would, for Kant, this have any conceivability role for determining what may be possible?
#+END_QUOTE
Recall that Kant posits a fundamental faculty, the "pure productive" imagination, that operates on an a priori manifold (e.g. pure space or pure time). It is the synthesis of this pure manifold that allows representation of space and time as objects. Insofar as (the representations of) space and time and all that appears in them constitutes the domain of what we can cognize as /really/ possible, imagination plays an important role in our grasp of modality and thus in the possibility of cognition proper.

This isn't quite right -- though Kant makes things especially confusing by introducing but not explaining his notion of "dialectic" and the dialectical inferences of reason.

Though we'll talk more about this in a few weeks, I can say something in class about the problem Kant sees with reason. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant says towards the end of the schematism that without schemata the categories only function as concepts but cannot represent any object.

Homogenous representations are representations that share (some of) the same content.

The schema is not an image (BI80). The schema is thinking about the dots as being represented by the number 3. Being able to represent the number 3 relies on a multiplicity of representations, and getting to the number three is just the procedure which applies a concept with an image.
#+END_QUOTE
Right, schemata are not images. Schemata are rules for generating images of objects. For example, the schema of the number /3/ will form the basis for my generating any of a variety of images of /3/ (e.g. three dots, three chairs, three taps, etc.)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“The general though to be sure only negative condition of all of our judgements whatsoever is that they do not contradict themselves” (BI90). What does he mean by the general though?
#+END_QUOTE
Remember that Kant conceives of logic as delineating the rules by which the intellect operates. So judgment, as an act of the mind, is governed by rules (logical rules). The law or rule of non-contradiction is the most basic rule of logic (in Kant's view) so it is "general" in the sense of being the most basic condition by which the understanding's operations may occur. No representation counts as a judgment if it is contradictory.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
What I found interesting in this week’s reading is the distinction between general logic and transcendental logic. Does this distinction give us a method of differentiating the logical functions of the understanding from the categories? 
#+END_QUOTE
I'm not sure whether we get a 'method', but the distinction tracks Kant's distinction between consideration of the laws of the intellect merely in and of themselves (pure general logic) an consideration of those laws as means of relating to objects (transcendental logic). Since, for us finite beings, we can only think of objects that are given via sensibility (and thus via intuition) transcendental logic always concerns for us objects as they must be given to us via our forms of intuition. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Is this because the categories have been derived from the logical functions of the understanding by means of transcendental logic rather than general logic, which is to say that the categories have content, whereas the logical functions of the understanding, being only the form of thought, have no content, and therefore cannot subsume an object to a concept, as the categories must do? 
#+END_QUOTE
If I'm understanding you correctly the short answer is "yes." The logical functions have no "content" because they have no relation to an object (this is typically what Kant means by "content" or "/Inhalt/"). The categories, as ways of synthesizing intuitions, do relate to objects (via the synthesis of the intuition) and so do have "content." But then, as you go on to describe, Kant thinks there is a problem of the "homogenity" of concept with intuition. We'll discuss this in greater detail in class (though see my answers to other folks about this issue too).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When it comes to conceiving of a polygon with a thousand sides, do we imagine it (visually) in the same way we do a triangle? Or do we have only an abstract notion of such a thing, with perhaps an accompanying “mental picture,” but not one that (as it were) “sensibly” bears that basic property in the way that our imagination can represent a triangle, circle, etc.?
#+END_QUOTE
This is a nice example to reach for, though, as you point out, Descartes is interested in making a slightly different point from the one Kant is interested in making. But both deny that the empiricist position according to which we represent kinds by means of particular mental images. 

In Kant's case the point is that no particular image is adequate to the content of a concept, so we need some way of /generating/ images that fit with our concepts without making the mistake of /identifying/ those images with the concepts. That is where schemata come in. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
to the extent mental images of triangles might be employed when thinking of them, we necessarily are comparing them to some kind of quick checklist of properties before endorsing or rejecting them as fitting the concept. (Something like that; this can work differently but isn’t where I’m going with my question.) How, though, do we succeed in making those comparisons so reliably? For if I’m comparing some object of my perception to the mental image of a triangle, and that image in turn to a triangle schemais there any way to say avoiding an infinite regress of such comparisons is necessarily possible?
#+END_QUOTE

First, one doesn't /compare/ an image to a schema -- the schema generates an image. So, for my concept of a triangle, the schema of that concept is a rule for generating an indefinite variety of different three-sided figures. This may be enough to avoid the regress. But there is also Kant's conception of the faculty of judgment as the faculty for subsuming objects under concepts. And Kant denies that we know how do to this by following rules, for a regress would result (B172). So he seems to think that we simply have a primitive capacity to judge correctly (and thus subsume an object under a concept), at least under optimal conditions (and which may need lots of practice), without having to follow further rules.

Does Kant here mean something like “If the concept of a plate includes circularity, then it has homogeneity with the concept of a circle?”

Yep -- Kant seems to think that "homogenity" in representation requires (in some sense) sameness of content. So there has to be a way in which the content of a concept (e.g. <round>) can be shared with the content of an intuition of an object (e.g. the intuition of a plate). 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
it seems to be the case that he has to think that there is some moment that constitutes the last noon-ish moment when considering the possible moments on their own (as opposed to in relation to other moments). And, given the rest of what he says about concepts and objects, it also seems that he thinks that, in principle, it’s possible for us mere mortals to know what that last noon-ish moment is.
#+END_QUOTE

Kant seems to think that all existing things are fully determinate. He begins the ‘Transcendental Ideal’ section of the /Critique of Pure Reason/ with a discussion of what he calls ‘the principle of complete determination.’ This principle states that every object is completely determinate with respect to every pair of predicates F and \not F, that is, every object is determinately either F, or \not F. But Kant denies that every /phenomenal/ object is completely determinate. This is especially clear from his discussion in the first and second "Antinomies" of the divisibility of objects and the totality of world whole (i.e. the cosmos). 

Kant thinks that if the spatiotemporal world were not ideal---i.e. if it existed entirely independently of us---it would have a determinate extent in space and time, because it would exist as a determinate, complete totality. But once we realise that the world of which we have experience does not exist independently of our being able to cognize it, we can explain how it could be that it does not exist as a determinate totality. We cannot cognize it as a determinate totality (neither as finite nor as infinite) so it doesn't exist as one (this is part of what makes Kant's position /idealist/ after all). In respect of its totality and its divisibility, Kant says that ‘the world of sense has no absolute magnitude’ (A521/B549). He says that because ‘the world does not exist at all (independently of the regressive series of my representations), it exists neither as an in itself infinite whole nor as an in itself finite whole’ (A505/B533). Kant thinks that we can explain how it can be that the world of sense has no determinate magnitude once we realise that the empirically real world is not completely independent of mode of experiencing it. Sine our cognition is of appearances only we aren't required to conceive of the world as 'determined in itself regarding its magnitude’ (A504/B532).

So Kant thinks the phenomenal world is possible for us to cognize but isn't determinate. Things as they are in themselves /are/ determinate, but are not possible for us to cognize.

My gut assumption prior to reading B225 was that Kant would not be inclined to affirm a doctrine of substances
#+END_QUOTE

Given that one of the categories concerns the substance-accident relation, it is a bit surprising to hear this. But there is also the question of what Kant is taken to affirm in the First Analogy. Given the argument structure of the Analogies Kant construes the substance-accident relation in temporal terms, as the difference between that which /persists/ and that which alters. Substance is that which persists (and which forms the basis for the conservation of matter law) and all accidents are understood in terms of the alterations of substance. 

For Kant, as for Aristotle, substances are the basic entities of metaphysical explanation; they substand or bear properties ("accidents") and they subsist or exist in a manner that does not require inherence in something else. Why think that reality has this structure? Well - Kant argues in the MD that this is the way we /have/ to think, this is part of what it is to say that the category is derived from the logical structure of judgment. But we can use the category to have cognition and knowledge of something beyond our own mind only insofar as the category is applied to experience, and thus "schematized" with respect to some intuited object. Are things in themselves such as exist in a way corresponding to our unschematized category of substance? Maybe, but we can never have sufficient theoretical grounds to have cognition of such beings (including ourselves!).

Hume's position is more radical than this. He argues that the traditional conception of casuastion as necessary connection is unfounded and a mere fiction. According to Hume all concepts (ideas) must be derived from experience (the stream of impressions).

Kant certainly can't say anything about the thing in itself.

I would think that the worry with your suggestion concerning the representation of house, at least as I am understanding it, is that it would multiply the number of objects we would have to represent as existing in the world.

when we have perceptions, the only way to know there is an event that corresponds to it is if we know that the event has a cause. I worry that this allows for the possibility of infinite regress. This is because we need to know the cause of an event in order to know that there is an event occurring. 
#+END_QUOTE

I think this would only be a problem if Kant were committed to (i) conceiving of causes as events and (ii) thought that identifying the cause required perceiving it. But I don't think he accepts either of these. Causes are, for Kant, substances and not events (i.e. alterations). And I can identify the cause of something (e.g. the stove as cause of the heat) without thereby being required to think of the stove as itself an event.  

But this issue does bring out one element of Kant's overall view -- we can only cognize determinate temporal relations back into the past or project towards the future insofar as we posit causal (temporal) laws relating events.

#+END_QUOTE

Kant denies that the cognition of succession is the result of either intuiting succession (B233). Instead we "connect two perceptions in time" via a synthesis of the imagination. So I can cognize the alternation of the sky's color as the sun nears the horizon because of the fact that I can hold together in one experience the intuition of the sky's being one color at time T_1 and another color at time T_2. I'm not sure whether this counts as "literally perceiving" succession in your sense.

If there is some way in which we can perceive succession considered by itself, then I wonder why it must be the case that the subjective sequence of apprehension would be “entirely arbitrary” without deriving it from an objective sequence of appearances (B 239).
#+END_QUOTE

I think the answer to this is that we cannot experience succession unless we have organized the succession of our subjective states according to a rule. The sense in which subjective sequence would be arbitrary is that one organization of a subjective sequence would be (epistemically speaking) just as good as another if we lacked the capacity to distinguish subjective from objective order.

why can’t we have something like a ‘regulative essences’ such that, we can reliably individate one object from another, describe the known causal powers that it possesses, and describe how parts of a given object relate to the whole of a given object?
#+END_QUOTE
This sounds like Locke's conception of a "nominal essence" and seems to be accounted for in Kant's conception of a "logical essence" (i.e. the perhaps merely working definition of a concept of a kind of thing). Kant gives an elucidation of his conception of definition in the Discipline of Reason towards the end of the book (A727/B755). 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant may have been comfortable with a doctrine of essences that conforms within limits that he has committed himself to?
#+END_QUOTE
Certainly Kant sometimes speaks as if we can have knowledge of the essential features of phenomena. This is especially clear in his discussion of the basic features of matter in his scientific work the /Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science/. For example, he says that repulsive force belongs to the "essence of matter" and seems to construe this in terms of the real essence of matter (see MFNS 4:511). But it is not entirely clear how he is conceiving of the essence of a phenomenal entity.

Is the categorical synthesis similar to the categories of the understanding, or something completely different?  I’m also a bit confused to what the definition of disjunctive synthesis is. 
#+END_QUOTE
Kant construes the activity of reason in terms of inference, and of inference in terms of the first or "major" premise in a syllogism. So the different syntheses of which reason is capable correspond to the forms which this first premise can take --- in Kant's view this is categorical (A is B), hypothetical (if A then B), and disjunctive (A or B).

What I can gather from Kant’s remark is that reason leads us to investigations that our understanding is not capable of solving. ... Is this close, if at all remotely, to what Kant is considering in terms of his critique of reason? Does reason have a similar quality to that of how Wittgenstein thought language lead us to be able to formulate unanswerable questions for Kant?
#+END_QUOTE
Yes to both questions. But Kant isn't just arguing that we can't answer the questions raised by reason. Rather, such question have *no* answer. Wittgenstein is making a similar point, though he frames it in terms of the conditions necessary for understanding a language rather than in terms of the faculties necessary for cognition.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[Kant] writes, “[if the above is your understanding of ‘contingent’], then I would gladly know by what means you intend to cognize the possibility of this non-being, if you do not represent succession in the series of appearances and in this succession an existence, which follows on not-being (or conversely), and thus a change.” It seems his point is simply that there is no way to cognize a series or succession of appearances on nothing, i.e., the mental content of my thoughts is incapable of representing anything coming from nothing.
#+END_QUOTE
I think that your interpretation, at least in broad strokes, is correct. Kant says something similar in the Second Analogy. He says, 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
That something happens, i.e., that something or a state comes to be that previously was not, cannot be empirically perceived except where an appearance precedes that does not contain this state in itself; for a reality that would follow on an empty time, thus an arising not preceded by any state of things, can be apprehended just as little as empty time itself. Every apprehension of an occurrence is therefore a perception that follows another one. (B237)

The point here seemingly is that we can only represent change in terms of alteration of an existing thing from one state to another, otherwise we would have to represent an "empty time", which is something that we cannot do.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
there is another way of intuiting positive noumenon, namely intellectual intuition. I am confused as to how this relates to what he was just saying about empiricism. The possibility of intellectual intuition seems to contradict the fundamental nature of empirical intuition. But then he says we can only understand noumenon in a negative sense. It seems like he is saying we cannot use intellectual intuition. 
#+END_QUOTE
Kant's view is that all cognition requires the intellectual grasp of an intuited object. Our form of intuition is receptive and sensible. But Kant allows that there may be another form of intuition that is "original", spontaneous, and intellectual rather than sensible (see B72). So this is intellectual intuition, conceived primarily by negating the various aspects of our sensible intuition and combining it with some basic features of our intellect. Saying that such a form of intuition is logically possible doesn't contradict our conception of empirical (sensible) intuition. 
*** Isabel Reynolds
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Does the claim “its possible to have an intellectual intuition that we don’t understand” suggest that all intellectual intuitions of this nature will never be our own? Or is it saying that (like space and time) we cannot fully grasp non-sensible intuitions?
#+END_QUOTE
Kant denies that human beings could ever have intellectual intuitions of any kind. We cannot even be sure that a being capable of such intuition is really possible. The notion of an intuitive intellect is merely logically coherent and thus epistemically possible. Kant in fact thinks that if there is a being capable of such intuition it would be Go,d and we cannot prove that God exists. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If Kant believes that there are non-sensible(intellectual) intuitions that we aren’t able to understand(like God), but denies positive noumena, then is he denying that God exists? Or is he claiming that we can understand some positive noumena, which would contradict the previous argument?
#+END_QUOTE
Kant isn't denying that god exists, since god would be the kind of being who would have an intuitive intellect and thus intellectual intuitions. But we can't have any cognition of such a being -- we cannot be sure god is really possible. So we cannot be sure that an intuitive intellect is really possible either.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
My question is, does Kant leave open the possibility of another kind of intuition, and therefore the possibility of cognition of things in themselves?

Kant thinks that it is logically possible that there is a being who intellectually intuits. He raises this at B72 and again in the Transcendental Deduction in §23.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Are we to be “realists” about noumena—if we want to think as Kant does here, at least—or can we take these to point to something like a shorthand interpretation of what “must be there” of things-in-themselves? After removing all that is sensible about a thing (however we do that), we have a “negative” conception of the noumenal. Are these things supposed to be real? 
#+END_QUOTE
Kant often presents his position as straightforwardly committed to the existence of things without (in both senses of that term) the mind. These "things as they are in themselves" are often connected with the negative conception of a noumenon. Such things exist, in the sense of having causal powers that affect our receptive sensibility and generate representations in our minds. In that sense such noumena are real. 
*** Zachariah Wrublewski

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Given that we can only appeal to noumena in the negative sense, I wonder if Kant has to think that noumena are real (where “real” means something different from his idea of “real possibility,” and something closer to contemporary metaphysical discussions of what’s real.
#+END_QUOTE
Certainly Kant conceives of nouomena in the negative sense as those things as they are in themselves and thus as the ground of what appears. So noumena, so understood, exist. Perhaps that is what you mean by "contemporary" conceptions of what is real?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
what’s to stop us from thinking that noumena are necessary fictions (or, maybe, to be quiet or uninterested in their ontological statuses as noumena) - where maybe fictions exist, in some sense, but are not identical to the objects of the fiction?
#+END_QUOTE

This would be to construe negative noumena or things as they are in themselves effectively as ideas of reason. Allais' point is that Kant never indicates that he has this view in mind. Kant also presents some metaphysical arguments against such a view. Phenomena consist entirely of relations. No being can exist per se, on its own, if it is entirely relational. So there must be something more to reality than phenomena.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I just don’t understand what Kant is saying. How can the self be neither an ‘appearance’ nor a ‘thing in itself’?
#+END_QUOTE
Fortunately Kant is not making the point you attribute to him, otherwise he would seem to be either adopting Hume's fiction view or just plain confused. 

The text at B423 says "An indeterminate perception here signifies only something real, which was given, and indeed only to thinking in general, thus not as appearance, and also not as a thing in itself (a noumenon)...". What are we to make of this? As I say in reply to Antony, this is a tough passage, and Kant isn't obviously not just painting himself into a corner. 

Part of the motivation of the passage is to say what was right about the /cogito/ claim that in thinking one knows that one exists, but say it in such a way that one doens't violate the critical condition on positive knowledge---i.e. /cognition/, which requires both intuition and concept/judgment. 

Pure apperception is not intuition, so my awareness of myself in pure apperception (e.g. in a thought "I think /p/") doesn't give me any object. So I can't /know/ or even /cognize/ my existence. But Kant does think that any case of pure apperception is a form of thinking, which is a kind of activity, and that activity generates (or shows up) appearances in inner intuition. So in thinking 'I think' I also have an inner intuition, which is the basis of the perception that "grounds this existential proposition" that I exist. As Kant says in the TD "my existence always remains only sensibly determinable, i.e., determinable as the existence of an appearance" (B158 note). So while pure apperception is, in a sense, the most basic way in which I am aware of my existence, if this awareness is to count as cognition/knowledge then there has to be intuition. 

None of this means that the self or subject is neither appearance nor thing in itself. Indeed, Kant is pretty clear that there has to be a subject as it is in itself that possesses all the mental capacities discussed in the CPR. But what is that subject? Julian Wuerth's paper (on the website) gives pretty clear evidence that Kant thought it had to be a substance with causal powers, but Kant can say both that /if/ we are genuine thinkers and moral agents then we have to be substances with causal powers, and also that we can never know (be certain) that we are such beings.

What I’m confused about is the definition of “single thing” (page 446) vs “simple substance”. It seems that Kant’s definition of single thing is the noumena, while substance is a subject subsisting for itself i.e. a subject that gives itself existence. What is the significant of this distinction
#+END_QUOTE
When Kant says that "the I of apperception, consequently in every thought, is a single thing that cannot be resolved into a plurality of subjects" he means that in every use of the concept <I> that use is singular.

As far as I understood what Kant was referring to when he spoke of rational psychology is generally philosophy related to investigating the nature of the soul.

Both empirical and rational psychology investigate the osul. They just do it differently. Empirical psychology is concerned with what may be learned via inner observation of one’s mental states. Rational psychology concerns what may be deduced from the a priori knowledge of oneself as a thinking subject, where this is based entirely the concept of such a thinker and not on any intuition of it (in inner or outer sense).

Does Kant see rational psychologists as failing to see the illusion of having access to the self as things in themselves as leading them to suppose they can partake in investigations of the nature of the soul?

Broadly speaking, yes. The basic problem, Kant thinks, is that the RP doens't respect the fact that they lack any intuition of the soul and so lack any representation of a determinate object of investigation. They then mistake what are legitiamte claims about how we must think of ourselves for illegitimate claims as to how we really are.

why not merely stipulate that [in premise 2] we mean the same thing by “what cannot be thought otherwise than as a subject” what we mean in premise 1?

Certainly one could do this. But Rosefeldt's point is that the claim in (2) is based on a particular fact---the fact that the concept <I> can only figure in subject place. But this doens't seem to be what (1) says, which Rosefeldt disambiguates as:

- [1] x cannot be thought otherwise than as subject /if x is given in intuition/ 
  
This is in contrast to [2]

- [2] x cannot be thought otherwise than as subject by x itself in mere thinking and independently from how x is given in intuition

The idea is that we can consistently either think of some determinate object that is only ever the subject of properties, or we can think of no particular object using a concept that can only ever take subject place in a judgment. And in a consistent use of one or the other notion we could draw legitimate conclusions. But mixing the two results in an invalid inference.

If we didn’t distinguish ourselves from other things, if we couldn’t cognize ourselves as distinct objects, how could we relate our experiences to the rest of the world around us?

#+END_QUOTE
Kant seems to think that part of what it is to think or represent objectively is to be able to dsintguish one thing from another, including oneself. Non-rational beings might be able to distinguish one thing from another, and themselves from other things, but they cannot represent, cognize, or know why it is that such things are distinct (including why they are distinct from other things).

Is Kant’s objection to e cogito ergo sum on the grounds of the category of existence? Specifically, in B423 Kant has a long sentence about perception through the category in regards to time, and existence not being a category yet.
#+END_QUOTE
The B423 note is a perplexing passage. Part of what Kant is doing is objecting to a (mis-)reading of Descartes according to which D derives his existence inferentially (i.e. via syllogism). Descartes is not, and does not take himself to be, doing this. But Kant is also expressing a (perhaps confused) view about the role of intuition in the cognition of one's existence. Remember that Kant thinks cognition requires both intuition and concept/judgment. So we shouldn't be able to cognize our existence via analysis of "I think" alone. We need some intuition or other of ourself. Kant says this more clearly in a note in the TD:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The *I think* expresses the act of determining my existence. The existence is thereby already given, but the way in which I am to determine it, i.e., the manifold that I am to posit in myself as belonging tO it, is not yet thereby given. For that self-intuition is required, which is grounded in an a prilffi given form, i.e., time, which is sensible and belongs to the receptivity of the determinable. 
#+END_QUOTE  
So in thinking "I think" (in pure apperception) my existence is given, but only in the sense of "something in general" or as an "indeterminate" object of thought. I need an empirical intuition in inner sense to get something like a determinate object of thought -- e.g. "I think I'm hungry."

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I’m not exactly sure what to make of “degrees of reality,” but I’d guess he means something like the powers of the substance in question weaken, or become worse (in some sense). But, it seems like his opponent might push back by asserting that even given the changing of properties in such a way, it cannot be that something has some degree of reality in one moment, and instantaneously have no degree of existence in the next. Or, to put it another way: the degradation of the intensive magnitude is merely a changing of properties, not the degradation of the reality of the substance; as such, it’s still the case that a simple substance cannot degrade (and therefore cannot be destroyed).
#+END_QUOTE
A variety of philosophers argued that the soul must be simple---i.e. without parts. If it has no parts it was often argued that it could not be material (since all matter has parts) and it could not "perish", where by the latter was meant, could not be dissolved into its components. If this were correct then all souls must be immortal, barring annhilation by some sufficient power (i.e. God). 

Kant's way of reading this argument is somewhat ingenious. He (rightly) accuses Mendelssohn of construing souls as lacking (in Kant's terms) extensive magnitude without acknowledging that they might nevertheless have intensive magnitude. The concept of intensive magnitude is understood in contrast to that of extensive magnitude. When we represent a quantity of something as "extensive", we represent it as made up of mutually external smaller parts, e.g., a certain quantity of space, or of matter, insofar as it is represented as composed of parts outside of one another. An "intensive" quantity, on the other hand, is an intensity, e.g., an intensity of heat, or of brightness, etc. When we represent a quantity of something as intensive, we do not represent it as made up of mutually external smaller parts. So in representing the brightness of an object as having a certain intensity, we do not thereby represent a certain degree of brightness as composed of distinct parts each of which has a lesser degree of brightness.

So it is perfectly plausible that a simple entity (an entity lacking parts) nevertheless possesses an intensive magnitude. Kant's next point is that if this is a cogent claim then it is also perfectly possible for the intensive magnitude of a simple entity to gradually (i.e. continuously through time) diminish to zero and thus cease to exist.

For Kant things are worse, than just the standard problem that from contradictions anything can be inferred, as he denies that we can coherently even /think/ any contradiction.

Kant seems to agree with you. He denies that reductio arguments could ever provide insight into the ground or explanation of anything. This is one of the reasons why the arguments provide an /indirect/ proof of TI.

If this is the case, the prior metaphysical commitments that are presupposed should be questioned, rather than reaffirmed, and if the antinomies are supposed to prove that a given commitment is problematic, this motivates me to question the prior assumptions rather than hold them as fixed and inexorable.
#+END_QUOTE
I'm not sure that Kant disagrees with you. He thinks that the explanation of why reason gets into the trouble that it does is that we assume Transcendental Realism, i.e. the view that that what appears to us in space and time is also what really exists independently of us and that what exists independently of us also appears to us in (or is at least subject to the conditions of) space and time. It is exactly this assumption that Kant encourages us to give up. Now there may be other "prior metaphysical commitments" that should also be given up, but Kant is claiming that the realist is in a difficult position that the idealist is not. So the question is whether he is ultimately correct about that. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If a wrong is wrong--if the argument is generating a contradiction- it is hard to see why I should conclude from a bad argument (one that yields contradictions) that anything at all is

Note that thesis and antithesis are (supposed to be) valid arguments via reductio to their respective conclusions. The problem is that both are valid with putatively plausible premises. Hence reason is incoherent. So the issue in the Antinomies is /not/ that there are bad arguments for certain kinds of conclusions, but that there seem to be very /good/ arguments for opposing conclusions. If that were correct then we could say very little in favor of rational inference, if it would tend to generate such opposing positions in even its best use. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
a simpler response to finding this kind of reductio argument is that there is probably an error in the clarity and/or formulation of the premises, rather than in the nature of the mind itself.

#+END_QUOTE
Ok - let's take these passages in turn. Kant says:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
as for space, in it there is no difference between progress and regress, because it constitutes an aggregate, but not a series, since all its parts exist simultaneously. ... since the parts of space are not subordinated to one another but are coordinated with one another, one part is not the condition of the possibility of another, and space, unlike time, does not in itself constitute a series (A412/B439)
#+END_QUOTE
His point here is that since the parts of space exist simultaneously so their manner of dependence is going to be different from a temporal series (whose parts succeed one another). Kant tries to get around this fact in two ways. He goes on to say, first, that the apprehension of parts of space, including in measurement, is successive, and second, that the boundedness of space (i.e. of a space as contained winthin another space) is also successive, one which has a regress (i.e. for some space, there is the space within which it is contained, and the space within which that space is contained, and so on...)

Kant goes on:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
reality in space, i.e., matter, is likewise something conditioned, whose inner conditions are its parts, and the parts of those parts are the remote conditions, so that there occurs here a regressive synthesis, whose absolute totality reason demands (A413/B440)
#+END_QUOTE 
Kant here points out that matter, as an extended impenetrable occupant of space is also conditioned in the sense that any arbitrary chunck of matter is a whole conditioned by its parts, and those parts have parts, and so on. The totality reason demands is, on the one hand, some part that is not itself conditioned by its parts, and on the other hand some whole which is not part of any further whole.

Kant thinks the existence of free action is incompatible with the temporally determined structure of the natural (i.e. phenomenal) world. So with respect to the natural world Kant is a "hard" determinist (nature is deterministic and there is no free will). But Kant is also a Transcendental Idealist, so phenomenal nature is not all that there is. He thinks it is logically and (perhaps) epistemically possible that things as they are in themselves can be causally self-determining. Hence it is possible that noumena are free.

#+END_QUOTE
I'm not entirely sure I understand your question. But if the question is whether reason is really spontaneous if it just operates according to laws (i.e. given some input it yields a determinate and predictable output) this is something Kant is concerned with. He wants to avoid an articulation of freedom according to which the rational agent has nothing more than the "freedom of a turnspit, which, when once it is wound up, also accomplishes its movements of itself" (CPrR 5:97). Whether Kant successfully does so is something we'll talk about tomorrow and return to in the coming weeks.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In order for Kant to argue that all happenings are caused by a previous state and that this previous state must itself have a cause, he argues that the previous state “itself must be something which has happened (come to be in a time when it previously was not)…” Thus, a happening is something which has a beginning before which it was not. Why say that?
#+END_QUOTE
Good question. Kant construes both the thesis and antithesis as committed to "Transcendental Realism", which (unlike Transcendental Idealism) does not make a distinction between appearances and things in themselves. Both theses thus construe things as (i) completely determinate---in the sense that for every pair of contradictory predicates one of them must be truly ascribed to each thing---and (ii) for any given conditioned thing, the series of its conditions must also be given, for otherwise that thing would not be completely determinate. So for a determinate happening to take place the complete temporal series of its conditions must also have occurred. This generates a contradiction because if we assume there is no first cause in time then we never get a complete series and so no determinate happening, and if we do assume a first cause in time we generate a contradiction with our conception of what a happening or even /is/. So reason, on the assumption of TR plus a conception of complete determination, contradicts itself.

But Kant agrees that given determinism, sufficient knowledge of the causal laws plus the previous state(s) of the universe will allow for prediction of future states, including the prediction of human behavior. Kant is pretty explicit about this in the first /Critique: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
all the actions of the human being in appearance are determined in accord with the order of nature by his empirical character and other cooperating causes; and if we could investigate all the appearances of his power of choice down to their basis, then there would be no human action that we could not predict with certainty, and recognize as necessary given its preceding conditions.

Kant says that this absolute causal spontaneity both begins from itself and follows the laws of nature. How can this be? How can this second form of causality follow the laws of nature if it goes against it by starting from itself?
#+END_QUOTE
Kant thinks that the conception of a free or spontaneous cause, and the conception of a natural cause, are in opposition -- they generate a contradiction. So his resolution of this Antinomy requires appealing to Transcendental Idealism. According to TI it is at least logically possible that some thing in itself acts as a first cause, while it is impossible for there to be any first cause amongst the sequence of appearances. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If causality is a priori then does the first cause come from an a priori concept like God?
#+END_QUOTE
I'm not sure what it would be for causality to be a priori? Perhaps you're stuck on the oddness of the phrase “a cause sufficiently determined a priori" (A446/B474)? What Kant means here is that if a cause is to be a sufficient reason or ground for its effect, then there must be a sufficient reason or ground for the cause as well. But if you mean to ask whether the first cause that Kant has in mind must be God, certainly that is one cause that he has in mind. But as we'll discuss tomorrow, he also want to see if the possibility can be left open that each of us, as rational agents, is also transcendentally free, and thus able to initiate a causal serious without being determined by external forces.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It struck me reading the Third Antinomy that the way Kant frames the discussion is far more obviously schematic than is usually the case, at least so far. ... is there a way Kant thinks the way he’s structured the argument is necessary to arriving at the logical truth of the conclusion? That is, is this a neat way of organizing his claims that Kant has landed on, or is this part and parcel of coming to think as he has about e.g. causation and sequence? 
#+END_QUOTE
Kant thinks that reason is driven to inquire about the conditions of things, and that the following principle leads to a problem: for any given conditioned thing (e.g. appearance) the whole set of conditions must also be given. But in each instance discussing the relevant whole series (marked by the topics of each Antinomy) reason delievers two distinct (and at least according to Kant) valid arguments for either contradictory or at least contrary conclusions. So here reason ends up in an argument with itself, an argument that is not obviously resolvable. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I wonder about how directly the influence on Hegel is from examples of Kant’s argumentation as this. 
#+END_QUOTE
This was very important to Hegel, who constructed his "dialectical" method in self-conscious imitation of the dialectic. On Hegel's view, however, the dialectical operation of reason isn't essentially error-generating. Instead, reason articultes point and counter-point, and then seeks to overthrow this opposition in a "synthesis" of the seemingly opposed positions.

I'm not seeing the contrast between predetermined and /necessarily/ predetermined here. Would it matter in terms of the process of first-person deliberation whether choices were predetermined, but only contingently, in that had a different initial state of the universe obtained then I would have been predetermined differently?

Wouldn't the possibility of being undetermined be enough, such that we could move on with our lives acting as if we were free...?

This is exactly the possibility for which Kant is arguing. He wants to make logical/rational space for the epistemic possibility that our actions are not subject to a thoroughgoing determinism.

I’m not sure how Kant can deny so much, and be so critical about all of the major metaphysical questions, and then somehow lean so heavily on teleology for the whole enterprise of ethics.
#+END_QUOTE
Kant's ultimate views concerning teleology are complex and perhaps conflicted. But it does not seem to be that implausible to construe human actions as oriented towards ends of one kind or another. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I don’t see how Kant can be so comfortable with these purposes of reason, freedom, and will (undermining reason’s work first, yet requiring purposive faculties). Just because reason wants something, and appears to say something, how can we trust it now? It has led us astray in the Dialectic by seeming to provide legitimate conclusions (falsely, we have learned), because, simply, that is just what it does.
#+END_QUOTE
Kant thinks that reason in its speculative use can lead us astray because it is subject to unavoidable illusions. But reason constrained by proper critique is, Kant argues, entirely trustworthy (though not infallible) and useful. Reason in its practical use is also subject to illusions of various kinds. From the /Critique of Practical Reason/:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
reason in its practical use is no better off. As pure practical reason it likewise seeks the unconditioned for the practically conditioned (which rests on inclinations and natural needs), not indeed as the determining ground of the will, but even when this is given (in the moral law), it seeks the unconditioned totality of the object of pure practical reason, under the name of the /highest good/. (CPrR 5:108)
#+END_QUOTE
Like speculative reason, practical reason can be caught in antinomies concerning what is the basis of the relation between virtue and happiness (the relation of equality comprising the highest good). But this doesn't show that practical reason is bad or useless, just that it needs 'critique.' Plus, as Kant goes on to argue in the Groundwork, morality is only possible for us if it is possible to be motivated from respect for the law alone (or as Kant sometimes puts it, motivated by reason or rational willing alone).

Kant uses "principle" to cover things like the moral law (in its various formulations) but also much more specific things like "Don't steal other people's things, even when doing so will cast no suspicion on oneself."

I would probably question the assumption in the statement that we can entirely put aside the influence of our inclinations when deciding what actions we may take...Does Kant every present an argument for why it possible to take an action entirely without the influence of inclination or does he just take this as given? 
#+END_QUOTE

In Groundwork I Kant is analyzing the concept of obligation -- duty -- and setting up the conditions for moral action. He is going to save his argument for our actually being able to act out of duty -- and so that we actually have obligations -- for Groundwork III. As for the claim that it is impossible to act without putting aside inclination, I suppose the question is what you mean by "putting aside." If the worry is that all action requires a motive, then Kant agrees with you. In the case of moral action the relevant motive is respect for the moral law. 

If the position you're gesturing at is rather that all action is done for the sake of one's welfare---the satisfaction of one's inclinations---then that is a position known as "[pschological egoism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egoism/#1)" and one must argue for it so as not to beg the question against the rationalist.

It seems at least conceivable that one could will lying promises to be universal.

Kant seems to think he's just analyzing the "common concept" of obligation. There may be moral relativists who disagree, but they are not the target of Groundwork I. That said, if Kant ends up saying nothing plausible about obligation or its relation to morality, then his positive argument that we act morally becomes less significant. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Kant considers "morality" and "ethics" as broadly synonymous, so I think the answer to your question, as I'm understanding it, is "yes."

Your first scenario seems perfectly possible, but I don't see what that has to do with Kant's worry that "a ground that is not moral will indeed now and then produce actions in conformity with the law, but it will also often produce actions contrary to the law."

I'm not sure that Kant 'takes for granted' that morality is 'an extension of rationality.'

A perfectly good will would, therefore, equally stand under objective laws (of the good), but it could not on this account be represented as necessitated to actions in conformity with law since of itself, by its subjective constitution, it can be determined only through the representation of the good.” What does Kant mean in this sentence? 
#+END_QUOTE
Kant means here that a perfectly good will or "holy will" would not be subject to rational (moral) imperatives because it would always act in accord with rational principles. In this case there would be no moral imperative for it but only the moral law, which would be perfectly descriptive of its will (in the way that, e.g., gravitational law is descriptive of the motions of objects). 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I’m also confused on Kant’s definitions of the three phrases: “problematically practical principle”, “assertorically practical principle”, and “apodictically practical principle”.
#+END_QUOTE
Let's take the first two. Start with construing all hypothetical imperatives as "if x, then y" claims. A problematically practical principle would be an imperative whose antecedent one may endorse or not. So with the imperative "if you want a spicy meal, go to /La Coxing/" one could accept or reject the antecedent of wanting a spicy meal as one pleases, and it may be the case that /no one/ accepts the antecedent. Contrast this with Esoteric practical principles, which all have as their antecedent the desire to be happy. Kant points out that all finite rational beings have happiness as an aim (we can thus "assert" it). 

Finally, an apodictically practical principle is just one whose antecedent is /necessary/---this is a somewhat strained way of trying to construe the categorical imperative as /unconditional/.

That definitely seems right. But presumably Kant does not disagree with you, especially since he denies in the Preface that acting morally requires an explicit grasp of the metaphysics of morals. The latter is necessary "because morals themselves remain subject to all sorts of corruption" (4:390) when we lack an explicit grasp of the fundamental principles of morality. So hard moral cases might get judged incorrectly without a metaphysics of morals, just like hard epistemological cases might get judged incorrectly without a proper epistemology.

Kant thinks that the unconditional nature of the moral imperative or demand is such that it is necessary and not contingently demanding. If it were only contingent then there may be conditions under which we escape it entirely. 

But Kant agrees that some kinds of crimes seem more transgressive of the law than others. He thinks that premeditated and calculated murder is worse than a murder from 'passion', because he thinks that in being in the grip of a passion one has less control (the action is less imputable) than in the case of cold calculation. This is a common theme in his lectures on ethics.

All imperatives "necessitate" but most imperatives are hypothetical, and thus one has the option of avoiding the demand by dropping or disowning the antecedent of the hypothetical claim.

I find it very interesting that Kant says happiness is possible for all human beings because it is in their essence. As far as I can tell, he does not make any argument here for why this is the case.

Kant thinks that all humans /aim/ at happiness (.e.g 4:418) but he certainly doesn't think that all /achieve/ happiness, nor does he think that one always has an action available to one that would make them happy.

Certainly such a view is among Kant's targets. He was at least familiar with the conception of the /phronimus/ or moral exemplar from Greek ethics in both its Aristotelian and Stoic versions.

Halfway through 4:414, Kant describes the categorical imperative and hypothetical imperative. Could an action be both categorically and hypothetically imperative?

No. An action cannot be done on the basis of an unconditional demand that is /also/ a merely conditional demand. Or is the question whether some action could have both categorical and hypothetical basis for being done? That is certainly possible. For example, suppose the question is whether to help your friend. There might be a hypothetical imperative involving the importance of helping friends if you want to avoid loneliness. But there is a also a categorical demand to be beneficent. So either way you ought to help your friend, but only one of the imperatives gets at a moral demand (or the motivation to meet such a demand).

Kant is certainly not saying, as you suggest, that "it is your duty to continue being in that position just because that’s how things are." He was no revolutionary, but in various ways he was radical for his time and place, and he did not aim at a simple preservation of the status quo.

This is a claim not that moral truths are cognized as objects (what would that even mean?) but that if morality is to be more than a mere 'figment of the brain', if it is to apply to the actions of actual beings, then it applies to /all/ rational beings, and not just human beings.

This is a problem for Kant's view as expressed. But say that a maxim says: In context C, do action A for purpose P, because that is G.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
it’s unclear to me what sorts of capacities Kant has in mind in this section of the Groundwork, and how these capacities are related to natural talents (unless the capacities themselves just are specific enough to directly relate to all natural talents).

Or, do I just have the more general capacities for having good hand-eye coordination, riding a horse well, etc.?
#+END_QUOTE
I think Kant means both the very general capacities you mention and much more specific "natural talents", such as being a talented violinist, or orator, or painter. The question is why we should think that deciding not to develop such a talent as one has results in a contradiction in willing (not in thinking).

It isn't clear what Kant's argument is for the primacy of practical reason, or even what this is supposed to ultimately mean. So this is an option we'll discuss in class. 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant says “The touchstone of whatever can be decide upon as law for a people lies in the question: whether a people could impose such a law upon itself.” It appears Kant believes think that the sovereign of any state has the right to forbid such freedoms, but wouldn’t condone such a situation. He also has a similar discussion in regards to freedom of religion. Is Kant being totally honest about his opinions or is he making concessions due to political reasons?
#+END_QUOTE
It is plausible that Kant might have wanted to couch his position in such a way that it didn't look hostile to monarchy, or as encouraging revolution. But he is plausibly interpreted as saying that the proper public use of reason is one of thinking or acting on principles that defer to no ungrounded "authority," hence on principles all can follow. Hence, the touchstone above is one of applying laws to all that all could rationally accept.

Kant...suggests that a clergyman as clergy is not free because he delivers the creeds of his church. ... However, as a scholar, and as publishing publicly, she “has complete freedom"... Ironically, this is the exact opposite strategy of some theologians and ministers who were neoorthodox. They would publish works which could be seen as making significant contributions to orthodox theology and subsequent creeds, and yet in private correspondence two prominent such clergy communicated that they thought that such doctrinal positions, as communicating propositions which might be taken to be “true” of religion, utterly mistaken (mainly because religion isn’t propositional in nature).
#+END_QUOTE
Here I think Kant's examples are misleading. His notion of "public" reason might be used only with respect to a very few (as in the epistolary exchanges you outline) and "private" use of reason may be to many (as in the publications you indicate). Kant's point is that it is only in the public use of reason that one accepts reason's authority on all matters (i.e. that one demonstrates autonomy) and does not allow reason's verdicts to be swayed by authority, feeling, or tradition. See also my answer to Zach below.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
my primary worry then is what Kant thinks is happening when I act in immoral ways. It seems as though, when I behave in a morally un-universalizable way, such as lying, I am still initiating my own non-natural causal chain of events. However, it is unclear to me how this action, or in what sense this action, is to be considered not free. 
#+END_QUOTE
Kant has issues explaining immoral action. The most straightforward thing to say is that even when I act immorally I nevertheless retain the capacity to act freely/morally, and so am blameworthy for the wrong thing I did. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It makes sense, intuitively, to rely primarily on our own knowledge, reason, and experience, and not that of others. 
#+END_QUOTE
I'm not sure that Kant saw this as so intuitive. He thought such "self-incurred" minority to be an extremely attractive way to live. Why think for yourself when others can do that for you? 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I will not be an expert in all fields (it might be a stretch just to be in one). So it seems, there will be a majority of my life’s knowledge that will depend fully on others. I simply cannot learn only by myself everything about biology, chemistry, physics, and philosophy
#+END_QUOTE
Kant is not saying that one needs to know everything (or even lots of things) there is to know oneself. That was pretty difficult in his day and is basically impossible now. The idea rather is to be able to /think/ for oneself---i.e. to be able to appreciate reasons for belief or action, to understand reasoned argument, to not accept things merely on the basis of authority, tradition, or personal inclination. 
*** Antony Larrick
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant refers to people who don’t necessarily think for themselves as minorities. I wonder why he chose that terminology.
#+END_QUOTE
See my answer to Izzy below. 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In his connecting pure practical reason with speculative reason, Kant speculative reason should be subordinate to pure practical reason, and this seems intuitive. Pure speculative reason without pure practical reason seems problematic, I can fairly easily imagine speculative reason creating problems where there are no problems, or solutions to problems that don’t seem cogent.
#+END_QUOTE
I'm not sure I see the subordination as intuitive, though this is partially because I'm not sure I understand what it means to subordinate one to the other. But certainly reason in its unbridaled speculative use causes all sorts of problems---such are the "dialectical inferences of reason" discussed in the first /Critique/. But practical reason encourages us to accept things such as the existence of god or the immortality of the soul on "practical" grounds, and it isn't clear that this is at all "intuitive" or less problematic or likely to get us into certain kinds of problems down the road. 
*** Isabel Reynolds
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When Kant lists human practices, like going to the doctor or seeking religion, he lost me.  “I need not think, If only I can pay” (8:35). Is he saying that living a semi-autonomous life is consistent with unconscious practices? Or that having anybody make a decision for you makes you the minority?
#+END_QUOTE
So "minority" is playing off the sense of being a /legal minor/, and thus of being unable to make decisions for oneself. Kant then conceives of "minority" in a related manner of being unable to use one's intellect (in the broadest sense of that term) autonomously, i.e. without being directed by authority, tradition, or one's own inclinations. Such minority is "self-incurred" because one lacks "resolution and courage to make use of it without direction from another."

When you blindly accept the dictates of doctors (e.g. think fad diets) or ministers (e.g. think of folks like Pat Robertson) without thinking for yourself, even though you possess the power to do so, then your minority is self-incurred. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
when Kant makes the distinction between private and public enlightenment it seems as if he’s saying public enlightenment is less challenging. Is that assumption correct?
#+END_QUOTE

It's not clear that he thinks a public enlightenment is /easier/. He just seems to think that while there will always be a "few independent thinkers", emphasis on individual pursuit of enlightenment may be a struggle. If we focus on making society free, then Kant (rather optimistically) thinks that their enlightenment will be "almost inevitable" though he does say that "a public can achieve enlightenment only slowly."

*** Jeffrey Schade
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
According to Kant, practical reason has “causality with respect to its objects” (4:448). Is this because the principle of morality is a synthetic proposition (4:447) and causality with respect to pure reason requires a schematized category of causality, which is synthetic? ... What kind of causality does practical reason have?  
#+END_QUOTE
Kant's idea here is that practical reason has causality by bringing about its objects in the sense of bringing about an action or state of affairs. Pure practical reason has a non-natural causality in the sense that it can determine the subject to choose a particular course of action wholly independently of any empirical inclination. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant seems to be saying that in order for the will to be autonomous, in cannot involve objects, but merely the form of volition (4:444). How does this relate to the “special kind of causality” that practical reason, or the will, has with respect to its objects (4:448)?
#+END_QUOTE
Kant thinks of pure practical reason as determining one's actions independent of empirical inclinations, and thus by virtue of a form of causality that is non-natural. Since it is a form of causality though it must have the form of a law, and thinks this "form of a law" is captured in the "Formula of Universal Law". 
*** Ryan Turner
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Kant...says: “As a rational being, and thus as a being belonging to the intelligible world, the human being can never think of the causality of his own will otherwise than under the idea of freedom; for, independence from the determining causes of the world of sense (which reason must always ascribe to itself) is freedom.” (G 4:452) Does Kant mean (or imply) here that the will is free only where independence from determination is /absent/? That is, do we act /from/ duty only where we have no inclinations coinciding with our choosing to so act?
#+END_QUOTE
The short answer is "no"; the longer answer depends on some of the things I've said in class concerning Kant's conception of the importance of virtue and good character. Kant plausibly thinks that when one isn't going against one's inclinations, it is much easier to do as morality requires. He also thinks we should all aspire to acquire or inculcate the mind of moral character according to which acting from respect for the moral law (i.e. freely and consciously doing as morality requires) generates its own kind of pleasure and motivation. So, e.g.,  having the kind of character such that you act to help others because that is the right thing to do inculcates in you a kind of pleasure in so helping others (even though you don't act /because of/ this pleasure) and thinking of others as ends in themselves and thus without price (and part of a kingdom of ends, etc.) as part of encouraging a general love of humanity, which itself helps foster one's moral proclivities. The key part is that all this comes as /outcome/ of following the moral law rather than trying to be its /ground/. 
*** Zachariah Wrublewski
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
it seems like there are many sorts of governmental posts that would, if restricting the freedom of the people holding the posts, threaten the progress of the enlightenment. For example, a government might have a propaganda minister, who, while being compelled to act in accordance with her job duties, appears as “scholarly” in the right sense, and uses psychological manipulation to alter the thoughts and ideas of the citizenry.
#+END_QUOTE

This seems like a fair worry. Some might object that Kant promotes here a shallow defense of freedom of opinion, which endorses (or is at least compatible with) a kind of "enlightened" despotism. The public/private distinction has been thus puzzling to many. But as Onora O'Neil has pointed out Kant conception of "public" here isn't the sense of a "big audience" but rather reasoners as such, which is why a "public" use of reason cannot take place in the public service, where relations of command and obedience allow only "private" uses of reason (the distinction is thus confusing in that way). Public use of one's reason does not permit acceptance of some rationally ungrounded "alien" authority (like the monarch, or president, or the news media). O'Neil think of the "private" use of reason as "defective"---a /privatus/ or privation---rather than simply being a narrower, or sheltered, etc. use of it. 

This way of construing the distinction thus wouldn't allow that one was acting freely, rationally, and thus morally in the kind of private uses that you propose. Moreover, Kant can plausibly argue that we should be promoting a society that does not force such "private" uses of one's reason.

*** First Passage
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Up to now it has been assumed that all our cognition must conform to the
objects; but all attempts to find out something about them a priori through
concepts that would extend our cognition have, on this presupposition, come to
nothing. Hence let us once try whether we do not get farther with the problems
of metaphysics by assuming that the objects must conform to our cognition,
which would agree better with the requested possibility of an a priori
cognition of them, which is to establish something about objects before they
are given to us. This would be just like the first thoughts of Copernicus,
who, when he did not make good progress in the explanation of the celestial
motions if he assumed that the entire celestial host revolves around the
observer, tried to see if he might not have greater success if he made the
observer revolve and left the stars at rest. Now in metaphysics we can try in
a similar way regarding the intuition of objects. If intuition has to conform
to the constitution of the objects, then I do not see how we can know anything
of them a priori; but if the object (as an object of the senses) conforms to
the constitution of our faculty of intuition, then I can very well represent
this possibility to myself. Yet because I cannot stop with these intuitions,
if they are to become cognitions, but must refer them as representations to
something as their object and determine this object through them, I can assume
either that the concepts through which I bring about this determination also
conform to the objects, and then I am once again in the same difficulty about
how I could know anything about them a priori, or else I assume that the
objects, or what is the same thing, the experience in which alone they can be
cognized (as given objects) conforms to those concepts, in which case I
immediately see an easier way out of the difficulty, since experience itself
is a kind of cognition requiring the understanding, whose rule I have to
presuppose in myself before any object is given to me, hence a priori, which
rule is expressed in concepts a priori, to which all objects of experience
must therefore necessarily conform, and with which they must agree. As for
objects insofar as they are thought merely through reason, and necessarily at
that, but that (at least as reason thinks them) cannot be given in experience
at all - the attempt to think them (for they must be capable of being thought)
will provide a splendid touchstone of what we assume as the altered method of
our way of thinking, namely that we can cognize of things a priori only what
we ourselves have put into them. (Bxvii-xviii)
#+END_QUOTE

*** Second Passage
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There is no doubt whatever that all our cognition begins with experience; for
how else should the cognitive faculty be awakened into exercise if not through
objects that stimulate our senses and in part themselves produce
representations, in part bring the activity of our understanding into motion
to compare these, to connect or separate them, and thus to work up the raw
material of sensible impressions into a cognition of objects that is called
experience? *As far as time is concerned*, then, no cognition in us precedes
experience, and with experience every cognition begins. But although all our
cognition commences *with* experience, yet it does not on that account all arise
*from* experience. For it could well be that even our experiential cognition is
a composite of that which we receive through impressions and that which our
own cognitive faculty (merely prompted by sensible impressions) provides out
of itself, which addition we cannot distinguish from that fundamental material
until long practice has made us attentive to it and skilled in separating it
out. It is therefore at least a question requiring closer investigation, and
one not to be dismissed at first glance, whether there is any such cognition
independent of all experience and even of all impressions of the senses. One
calls such *cognitions a priori*, and distinguishes them from *empirical* ones,
which have their sources /a posteriori/, namely in experience. (B1-2)

Kant's project of defending our knowledge of true synthetic a priori judgments
in metaphysics requires a defense of the legitimacy of the basic concepts of
metaphysics. But which concepts are the most basic? This week we start our
discussion of the Transcendental Analytic with a look at the section of the
/Critique of Pure Reason/ called the "Metaphysical Deduction", in which Kant
gives us an argument for determining which concepts are fundamental to
metaphysics, and how they could be cognized a priori.

*** First Passage
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are only two possible cases in which synthetic representation and its objects can come together, necessarily relate to each other, and, as it were, meet each other: Either if the object alone makes the representation possible, or if the representation alone makes the object possible. If it is the first, then this relation is only empirical, and the representation is never possible /a priori/. And this is the case with appearance in respect of that in it which belongs to sensation. But if it is the second, then since representation in itself (for we are not here talking about its causality by means of the will) does not produce its object as far as its *existence* is concerned, the representation is still determinant of the object /a priori/ if it is possible through it alone to *cognize something as an object*. (A92/B124-5)
#+END_QUOTE

*** Second Passage
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The *I think* must *be able* to accompany all my representations; for otherwise something would be represented in me that could not be thought at all, which is as much as to say that the representation would either be impossible or else at least would be nothing for me. That representation that can be given prior to all thinking is called *intuition*. Thus all manifold of intuition has a necessary relation to the *I think* in the same subject in which this manifold is to be encountered. But this representation is an act of *spontaneity*, i.e., it cannot be regarded as belonging to sensibility. I call it the *pure apperception*, in order to distinguish it from the *empirical* one, or also the *original apperception*, since it is that self-consciousness which, because it produces the representation *I think*, which must be able to accompany all others and which in all consciousness is one and the same, cannot be accompanied by any further representation. I also call its unity the *transcendental* unity of self-consciousness in order to designate the possibility of /a priori/ cognition from it. (B132)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Understanding belongs to all experience and its possibility, and the first thing that it does for this is not to make the representation of the objects distinct, but rather to make the representation of an object possible at all. Now this happens through its conferring temporal order on the appearances and their existence by assigning to each of these, as a consequence, a place in time determined /a priori/ in regard to the preceding appearances, without which it would not agree with time itself, which determines the position of all its parts /a priori/. Now this determination of position cannot be borrowed from the relation of the appearances to absolute time (for that is not an object of perception), but, conversely, the appearances themselves must determine their positions in time for each other, and make this determination in the temporal order necessary, i.e., that which follows or happens must succeed that which was contained in the previous state in accordance with a general rule, from which arises a series of appearances, in which by means of the understanding the very same order and constant connection in the series of possible perceptions is produced and made necessary as would be encountered /a priori/ in the form of inner experience (time), in which all perceptions would have to have their place.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The concept of causality as /natural necessity/, as distinguished from the concept of causality as /freedom/, concerns only the existence of things insofar as it is /determinable in time/ and hence as appearances, as opposed to their causality as things in themselves. Now, if one takes the determinations of the existence of things in time for determinations of things in themselves (which is the most usual way of representing them), then the necessity in the causal relation can in no way be united with freedom; instead they are opposed to each other as contradictory. For, from the first it follows that every event, and consequently every action that takes place at a point of time, is necessary under the condition of what was in the preceding time. Now, since time past is no longer within my control, every action that I perform must be necessary by determining grounds /that are not within my control/, that is, I am never free at the point of time in which I act. Indeed, even if I assume that my whole existence is independent from any alien cause (such as God), so that the determining grounds of my causality and even of my whole existence are not outside me, this would not in the least transform that natural necessity into freedom. For, at every point of time I still stand under the necessity of being determined to action by /that which is not within my control/, and the series of events infinite a parte priori which I can only continue in accordance with a predetermined order would never begin of itself: it would be a continuous natural chain, and therefore my causality would never be freedom. If, then, one wants to attribute freedom to a being whose existence is determined in time, one cannot, so far at least, except this being from the law of natural necessity as to all events in its existence and consequently as to its actions as well; for, that would be tantamount to handing it over to blind chance. But since this law unavoidably concerns all causality of things so far as /their existence in time/ is determinable, if this were the way in which one had to represent also the /existence of these things in themselves/ then freedom would have to be rejected as a null and impossible concept. Consequently, if one still wants to save it, no other path remains than to ascribe the existence of a thing so far as it is determinable in time, and so too its causality in accordance with the law of /natural necessity, only to appearance, and to ascribe freedom to the same being as a thing in itself/.

** CANCELED Commentary on the Deduction Argument
Below I discuss the various sections of the argument of the Deduction, as well as raise questions concerning its various parts. This commentary is by no means complete, nor do I avoid making entirely uncontroversial assumptions. The aim of the commentary is simply to provide /one/ way of getting through the thicket of Kant's argument.


*** The Nature of a Transcendental Deduction and Transition to the Argument (§§13-14)

Kant states the task of the Transcendental Deduction in §13. He says that a transcendental deduction is an explanation of "the way in which concepts may relate [/sich beziehen/] a priori to objects" (A85/B117). The reason why such a relation is a problem concerns Kant's account of how concepts are generated. For Kant, as for empiricists like Locke and Hume, empirical concepts are derived via reflection upon similarities and differences present in a subject's sensory states, from which a concept is then generated via abstraction.[fn:59] Such concepts thereby get their content from experience and their legitimate use is governed by their content. Hence, for any empirical concept, showing the kind of experience from which it derived (though not necessarily the actual experience) is sufficient to demonstrate the legitimacy [/Rechtsmäßigkeit/] of the content, and thus of the use of the concept (A85/B117).[fn:60]

The pure a priori concepts cannot draw on such a demonstration---what Kant calls an "empirical deduction"---for proof of their legitimacy. This is for two reasons. First, since they are a priori they cannot be derived from any particular experience (B2-3). Second, the content of the a priori concepts includes the notions of /universality/ and /necessity/ (A94/B126). This is to say that if an application of an a priori concept is to be successful then that concept must apply necessarily to its subject matter and must apply universally to all relevantly similar subject matter.

So Kant faces a problem---viz. how is it that the categories are legitimately applied to objects of experience given their a priori status and necessary/universal content? He cannot give an "empirical deduction" for such concepts since they are not abstracted from sense experiences. And his worry is plainly that since such concepts are not abstracted from sensory experience (indeed, any possible such experience) there is a problem in explaining how they could (necessarily and universally) apply to objects of experience.  

[fn:59] See A85/B117, A262/B318; /JL/ §6 9:94-5; Locke EHU II.XII.9,
        II.XII.1; Hume THN I.I.7.2. The relation of Hume's position to
        Kant is in fact more complicated than this since Hume regards
        ideas as less forceful and lively /copies/ of impressions rather
        than abstractions from them; THN I.I.1.1. But Hume does regard
        abstract ideas as involving abstraction, and it is these ideas
        which most closely resemble Kant's understanding of concepts
        [/Begriffe/].

[fn:60] This form of /empirical deduction/ would be insufficient for a priori concepts (A85-6/B118). So too would a demonstration of how rational beings were caused to possess the conceptual capacities in question. This would be a merely /physiological derivation/ (A86-7/B118-19).

*** The First Step (§§15-21)

*** The Second Step (§§22-27)
*** Deduction Notes
**** Unity of Objects 
1. Every object, as an object, possesses a principle of unity
2. Cognition of an object requires the correct representation of its principle of unity
3. We have cognition of objects
4. \therefore C1: We are able to know (and in fact know of some object) that we correctly represent the PUs of objects (from 1-3)
5. Either our cognitions must conform to objects or objects must conform to our cognition of them
6. If our cognition must conform to objects then we can never know whether we have correctly represented their principles of unity
7. \therefore C2: Objects, at least with respect to their principles of unity, must conform to our cognition of them (C1, 5, 6, MT)

   
- What is an "object"?
  - An "object" for Kant is a unity of multiplicity
- What is a principle of unity?
  - A principle that explains the necessity of connection(s) between elements of a multiplicity (e.g. the real essence of a thing)
- What is "conformity"? 

**** The Deduction

- The "Difficulty": :: The intuited given might not conform to the categories, even though it must conform to the "principles" of space and time (TD §13, A89-90/B122)


***** §15 - The unity problem
Section 15 states the unity problem and why it cannot be resolved via appeal to sensibility or its output

***** §§16-18 Apperception
These sections argue that unity can only be achieved by a being capable of self-consciousness, and that such self-consciousness would be /intellectual/ rather than /sensory/. 

***** §19 Logical form
The logical form of /judgment/ (as opposed to association) depends on the unifying activity of self-consciousness

***** §20 Intuition
Intuition of an object /as an object/ requires the generation of unity that is only possible via the self-conscious activity of the thinking subject 

- Why isn't the Deduction done with §20?

  :END:

One of the major philosophical disputes in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries concerned the issue of space (and, also, time---though I'm mostly going to
talk about space in what follows). What is space? By the mid-eighteenth
century there were two major competing positions. On the one hand, following
Newton, many philosophers and scientists construed space as a kind of
/subsisting entity/. On this view space (and correspondingly time) exists
independently of any possible /object/ that may occupy space, and independently
of any possible /relations/ between such space-occupying objects. Space is, on
this view, a kind of container in which objects are placed. Spatial relations
(e.g. position, relative motion) are determined by the relations which objects
have to this container space, and the relations of these spaces (or spatial
regions) to one another. Call this the '/absolute/' conception of space.

In contrast to the conception of space as absolute, Leibniz proposed that
space is merely a set of relations that hold between independently specifiable
objects. This '/relationalist/' conception of space says that space is /not/
something that exists over and above the objects which occupy it. It is merely
the order of possible relations between distinct existing substances. So while
we could, on the relationalist view, conceive of empty space, insofar as we
conceive of the possible relations which substances might enter into, space
could not exist as something independent of any such set of possible objects
and their (possible) relations.

In the /Critique of Pure Reason/ Kant argues against /both/ of these theories of
the metaphysics of space. His suggestion is that space is neither a subsisting
container entity nor a set of relations between independent objects, but
rather something else---a product of our subjective apprehension of objects
that are distinct from us. It is, in Kant's phrase, a 'form of intuition'.

*** The Metaphysical Exposition of Space

[[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-spacetime][Kant's arguments]] concerning the nature of space and the nature of our
representation of it occur in the 'Metaphysical Exposition' of the first
/Critique/. Kant makes four arguments here, which raise a variety of questions
concerning their proper interpretation. Part of the complexity of
interpretation is due to the difficult nature of Kant's arguments. He is
trying to do several things simultaneously. First, he is intervening in a
debate concerning the ontological status of space---is space a subsisting
thing (absolutism) or is it an order of relations (relationalism)? Second, he
is concerned with answering the question as to the origin of our
/representation/ of space. Space is different from the objects that are in it,
and in some ways seems to be a condition of representing spatial objects. So
where does this representation of space come from? How could it come (if we
endorsed empiricism) from an experience of objects? Third, Kant is concerned
with the content or nature of the representation of space. Is it a
fundamentally intellectual (conceptual) kind of representation or is it a
sensible one?

Kant's first two arguments (at A23-4/B38-9) run as follows:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
1.) Space is not an empirical concept that has been drawn from outer
experiences. For in order for certain sensations to be related to something
outside me (i.e., to something in another place in space from that in which
I find myself), thus in order for me to represent them as outside <and next
to> one another, thus not merely as different but as in different places,
the representation of space must already be their ground. Thus the
representation of space cannot be obtained from the relations of outer
appearance through experience, but this outer experience is itself first
possible only through this representation.

2.) Space is a necessary representation, a priori, that is the ground of all
outer intuitions. One can never represent that there is no space, though one
can very well think that there are no objects to be encountered in it. It is
therefore to be regarded as the condition of the possibility of appearances,
not as a determination dependent on them, and is an a priori representation
that necessarily grounds outer appearances  
#+END_QUOTE
  

There are a variety of possible targets for these arguments, but at least one
target relates to our second question above concerning the origin of the
representation of space. Specifically, Kant is querying the claim that the
representation of space is drawn from the content of our experience. This is
particularly clear from the first argument, as Kant seems there to be denying
the Lockean claim (/Essay/, II.xiii.2-4) that the representation of space is
derived from the representation of the distances between objects. Kant's point
(or a point) in the argument (1) is that we cannot represent one object as
/distant/ from another without already representing them as being in one space
in which they are related. More generally, Kant's claim seems to be that we
cannot represent to object as spatially /related/ without presupossing a more
general (and distinct) capacity to represent the space in which those
relations stand (on this, see especially @warren1998).

Kant's second argument is perhaps less persuasive, for it argues that we
cannot represent a lack of space. Certainly, this fact would seem to go
against the empiricist view of space as something we learn from experience.
But it seems that the empiricist might counter that once the representation of
space is gained via experience, we cannot part with it psychologically, and so
cannot represent its absence. Kant's "cannot" needs to be more than just a
psychological "cannot", and I don't see that he provides the argument
necessary to show that the empiricist position founders.

Thus, with these first two arguments Kant attempts to refute a particular
position concerning the /source/ of our representation of space---viz.
experience. The representation of space is not to be found in the content of
our experience, rather, outer experience presupposes that its content will
consist of spatially related items. Spatial representation is thus presupposed
by our having any representation of anything distinct from ourselves or other
things at all. Thus, if the first two arguments are correct, the
representation of space is a priori and not empirical. This still leaves open
our first question concerning what space /is/. It also leaves open our third
question concerning whether the representation of space is sensory or
intellectual in nature. It is with this issue that Kant's next two arguments
are concerned.

Kant's third and fourth arguments (B39-40) run as follows:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

3.) Space is not a discursive or, as is said, general concept of relations of
things in general, but a pure intuition. For, first, one can only
represent a single space, and if one speaks of many spaces, one
understands by that only parts of one and the same unique space. And
these parts cannot as it were precede the single all-encompassing space
as its components (from which its composition would be possible), but
rather are only thought in it. It is essentially single; the manifold in
it, thus also the general concept of spaces in general, rests merely on
limitations. From this it follows that in respect to it an /a priori/
intuition (which is not empirical) grounds all concepts of it. Thus also
all geometrical principles, e.g., that in a triangle two sides together
are always greater than the third, are never derived from general
concepts of line and triangle, but rather are derived from intuition and
indeed derived /a priori/ with apodictic certainty.

4.) Space is represented as an infinite *given* magnitude. Now one must, to be
sure, think of every concept as a representation that is contained in an
infinite set of different possible representations (as their common
mark), which thus contains these *under itself*; but no concept, as such,
can be thought as if it contained an infinite set of representations
within itself*. Nevertheless space is so thought (for all the parts of
space, even to infinity, are simultaneous). Therefore the original
representation of space is an /*a priori/ intuition*, not *a concept*.
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's interest in these two arguments is with our third question, and his aim
(or one aim) is to deny the view that the content or nature of the
representation of space is fundamentally intellectual (in the sense of
originating in the intellect). According to Kant, spatial representation is
not fundamentally intellectual or conceptual, but rather 'intuitive'. This is
not to say that spatial representation is /sensory/. We do not have a sensory
representation of an infinite space! Kant is trying to carve out room for a
position according to which we have a non-sensory but also
non-conceptual/non-intellectual representation of an infinite space, which makes
possible our representation of particular spatial expanses. There are
similarities here between Kant's argument and previous rationalist arguments
concerning the priority of the infinite over the finite. Kant's third argument
above is that the single infinite expanse of space is prior to, in the sense
of being presupposed by, the existence of any particular spatial region.
Kant's fourth argument reinforces this by arguing that /if/ spatial
representation were conceptual (on Kant's understanding of conceptual
representation) then we would have to represent an infinite number of spaces
or spatial regions. This would present us with an infinite task, which we
would obviously be unable to accomplish. Since Kant thinks we clearly do
represent space as an infinite expanse, we must be doing so /non-conceptually/.

*** The Transcendental Exposition of Space

The central argument of the TE, the so-called 'argument from geometry' was
originally part of the ME, located between the two pairs of arguments
discussed above. Kant moves this argument to its own section in the second or
"B-edition" of 1787. It is not clear, however, what the argument actually is.
Is it an argument concerning the status of the representation of space as
ultimately an a priori intuition? Is it an argument concerning the dependence
of the science of geometry on space so understood? Is it an argument
concerning something else entirely?

**** The Argument from Geometry

The argument proceeds as follows,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Geometry is a science that determines the properties of space
  synthetically and yet /a priori/. What then must the representation of
  space be for such a cognition of it to be possible? It must originally
  be intuition; for from a mere concept no propositions can be drawn
  that go beyond the concept, which, however, happens in geometry
  (Introduction V). But this intuition must be encountered in us /a
  priori/, i.e., prior to all perception of an object, thus it must be
  pure, not empirical intuition. For geometrical propositions are all
  apodictic, i.e., combined with consciousness of their necessity, e.g.,
  space has only three dimensions; but such propositions cannot be
  empirical or judgments of experience, nor inferred from them
  (Introduction II). (B41)
#+END_QUOTE

It is not altogether clear what Kant is arguing here. He is commonly
interpreted along the following lines.[fn:2018-08-02-1431]


1. We have synthetic a priori cognition of Euclidean geometry Or:
   Euclidean geometry is necessarily true
2. Such cognition is possible only if space is a pure intuition Or: pure
   intuition of space is a necessary condition of our synthetic a priori
   cognition of geometry
3. \therefore Space is a pure intuition.

One problem with this interpretation of Kant's argument is that it goes
against the methodology Kant is supposedly following in the CPR as
opposed to the /Prolegomena/. Kant puts the distinction this way in his
logic lectures:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Analytic is opposed to /synthetic/ method. The former begins with the
  conditioned and grounded and proceeds to principles (/a principiatis
  ad principia/), while the latter goes from principles to consequences
  or from the simple to the composite. The former could also be called
  '/regressive/' and the latter '/progressive/' (JL 9:149)
#+END_QUOTE

With the synthetic method one sets out from first principles/conditions and
derives from them what one can. With the analytic method, one starts from some
given claim and from it proceeds via a regressive analysis to its conditions.
The synthetic method is constructive while the analytic method is
deconstructive. Kant take the CPR to be arguing from first principles
regarding cognition to the existence of particular kinds of synthetic a priori
knowledge. In the /Prolegomena/ Kant is starting from the existence of such
synthetic a priori knowledge (in natural science and in mathematics) and
giving a regressive analysis of its conditions (4:263, 274-5).

Unfortunately, Kant's use of these methods in each of the works is not
altogether clear. To take just two examples, Kant seems to give
regressive analytic arguments both in the Transcendental Exposition of
Space, above, and in the Transcendental Deduction of the Categories. It
is not clear whether this is really compatible with the synthetic method
supposedly being followed in the /Critique/.[fn:45] So appeal to the
distinction between methods cannot, of itself, ground acceptance or
rejection of any particular interpretation of the argument in the TE.

Lisa Shabel -@shabel2004 interprets Kant's argument as /synthetic/, and thus as
arguing /from/ the notion that the representation of space is a pure a priori
intuition /to/ the claim that such a representation of space is the foundation
for our cognition of geometric objects and relationships. According to Shabel
the argument from geometry functions as a 'bridge' from the arguments of the
Metaphysical Exposition, which purport to show that space is an a priori
intuition, to the arguments concerning the transcendental ideality of space---
i.e., that it is /nothing other than/ a pure a priori intuition.[fn:46]

At least three things work in favor of Shabel's interpretation. First,
it accords with Kant's claim that the method of argument in the first
/Critique/ proceeds synthetically rather than analytically, though, as
was remarked above, this cannot be a decisive issue. Second, it makes
sense with respect to the position of the TE in the Aesthetic as a
whole. It would be surprising if Kant meant the TE to be an argument for
construing the representation of space as a priori and a pure intuition,
since this seems to be what he intends the Metaphysical Exposition to
accomplish. Third, as previously noted, the argument of the TE was, in
the first edition of the CPR, located in the ME. A plausible explanation
as to why it was moved would be that Kant did not in fact take it to be
an argument /for/ the status of the representation of space as
originally a pure a priori intuition, and thus decided to give it its
own section instead. This is perhaps made clearer by Kant's emphasis on
the role of the TE in the Aestehtic.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I understand by a transcendental exposition the explanation of a
  concept as a principle from which insight into the possibility of
  other synthetic /a priori/ cognitions can be gained. For this aim it
  is required 1) that such cognitions actually flow from the given
  concept, and 2) that these cognitions are only possible under the
  presupposition of a given way of explaining the concept. (B40)
#+END_QUOTE

So, on Shabel's reading, the TE does not give a new argument for the
status of spatial representation as a priori and an intuition, but
rather provides reason for construing spatial representation as the only
explanation of geometric cognition. On Shabel's reinterpretation the
argument proceeds as follows.

1. The representation of space is a pure a priori intuition (from the
   ME).
2. Geometry is a science of synthetic a priori propositions concerning
   the structure of space

   - We need an explanation of (a) the a priori representation of space
     as an object and (b) the status of the propositions of geometry as
     synthetic rather than analytic.

3. Since (according to the ME) the representation of space is a priori,
   we know that the geometer's representation of its properties is
   likewise a priori.
4. Since (according to the ME) the representation of space is originally
   an intuition, we know that the status of propositions concerning the
   nature of space is ultimately synthetic.
5. \therefore The status of the propositions of geometry as synthetic
   and a priori is explained by the pure a priori intuitive
   representation of space --- geometric cognition depends on the
   representation of space understood in the terms set out in the ME.

*** The Ideality of Space

Thus far Kant has made arguments for two of our three topics. He's
argued that the source of our representation is not empirical, and thus
that the representation of space is a priori. He has also argued that
the nature or 'content' of the representation is intuitive rather than
conceptual. But what about the ontology of space? Is space a subsisting
thing, capable of existince independent of any and all objects or their
relations(absolutism)? Or is it merely the set of possible relations
which objects may stand in (relationalism)?

After Kant gives the arguments discussed above he draws two surprising
conclusions (A26/B42). First, he argues that
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

a.) Space represents no property at all of any things in themselves nor
   any relation of them to each other, i.e., no determination of them
   that attaches to objects themselves and that would remain even if
   one were to abstract from all subjective conditions of intuition.
   For neither absolute nor relative determinations can be intuited
   prior to the existence of the things to which they pertain, thus be
   intuited /a priori/. (A26/B42)
#+END_QUOTE


This is surprising because, from what Kant has said in the above arguments, he
has only been discussing our /representation/ of space. But here he makes a
claim concerning the /metaphysical status/ of space---viz. that it is nothing
'in itself'. He then goes on to explain what space actually is.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

b.) Space is nothing other than merely the form of all appearances of
   outer sense, i.e., the subjective condition of sensibility, under
   which alone outer intuition is possible for us. Now since the
   receptivity of the subject to be affected by objects necessarily
   precedes all intuitions of these objects, it can be understood how
   the form of all appearances can be given in the mind prior to all
   actual perceptions, thus /a priori/, and how as a pure intuition,
   in which all objects must be determined, it can contain principles
   of their relations prior to all experience. (A26/B42)
#+END_QUOTE


So, according to Kant, space is nothing in itself but rather only a
representation---viz. the form by which we represent distinct objects. How
does he get to this conclusion?

First, Kant rejects a presupposition he thinks both the absolutist and the
relationalist about space hold in common---viz. that space is something
independent of the mind in general and our perception (or intuition) in
particular.[fn:47] In Kant's terminology space is /ideal/ in virtue of being
mind-dependent. Kant makes this point clearer later in the /Critique/.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I understand by the *transcendental idealism* of all appearances the doctrine"
  that they are all together to be regarded as mere representations and not as
  things in themselves, and accordingly that space and time are only sensible
  forms of our intuition, but not determinations given for themselves or
  conditions of objects* as things in themselves. To this idealism is opposed
  *transcendental realism*, which regards space and time as something given in
  themselves (independent of our sensibility). The transcendental realist
  therefore represents outer appearances (if their reality is conceded) as
  things in themselves, which would exist independently of us and our
  sensibility and thus would also be outside us according to pure concepts of
  the understanding. (A369)
#+END_QUOTE

This perhaps makes clearer why Kant thought he was making a move with
respect to the debate between absolutists and relationalists about
space---both positions assume that space is 'transcendentally real'. But
why think that space is 'transcendentally ideal' in the first place?
What licenses the move from a claim about space as an a priori intuitive
representation to the claim that space is /only/ the form of outer
intuition?

According to Kant, intuition is an 'immediate' and 'singular' awareness of an
object. This contrasts with the conceptual representation of an object, which
is 'mediate' and 'general'. The role of intuition, Kant says, is to present us
with objects, while concepts allow for thought of such objects (A320/B377; see
also A19 and A50/B74). Kant's argument for the ideality of space proceeds from
this definition of intuition (see /Prolegomena/ §§8-10; cf. @allais2010a)

1. Intuition necessarily involves relation to an object
2. We have an a priori intuition of space (and time)
3. A priori intuition cannot, by definition, be a relation to an existing
   object
4. \therefore Space is nothing other than a 'pure' a priori intuition

Kant's thinking here is that the role of intuition is to present its
subject with an object. Intuition is what makes the difference between
merely thinking or daydreaming about something and actually having it
/present/ to one's mind. But, if this is right then there cannot be some
/existing/ thing that is present to one in an a priori intuition, since
the definition of the a priori requires that the intuition be
independent of experience and thus of any existing object.

Thus, (1) follows from Kant's definition of intuition. (2) follows from the
arguments of the Metaphysical exposition concerning the a priority and
intuitive status of our representation of space. (3) is the crucial premise,
but this seems to follow from the fact that a pure intuition must present
something, and that something, in the absence of any experience, cannot be an
actual object, but merely a feature of the mind itself. This gets us (4), that
space is nothing other than a form of mental representation and not something
subsisting in itself, or an order of possible relations between objects,
independent of the mind.

*** Incongruent Counterparts

In §13 of the /Prolegomena/, which was a sort of summary version of the
arguments we've been looking at so far in the /Critique of Pure Reason/,
intended to introduce Kant's readers to the main themes of that work, Kant
makes an argument concerning what he calls 'incongruent counterparts',
perfectly similar objects that are mirror images of each other, such as left
and right hands. This argument, he thinks, shows us that space cannot be
mind-independent, but must be an intuition.

Kant was highly enamored of this argument. He used it first in 1768, to
argue that space was Newtonian (absolute) rather than Leibnizian
(relational). In 1770, he used the argument for a different conclusion,
that our knowledge of space is via intuitive not conceptual
representation. The /Prolegomena/ argument of 1783 is for a still
different conclusion, that space is ideal. So what exactly is the
argument and how could it serve all these conclusions?

Let's look briefly at the first two uses of the argument (cf.
@vancleve1991a; @vancleve1991b). Kant's argument against the
Leibnizian relationalist position hinges on the fact that according to
the Leibnizian relationalist, all spatial relations are a function of
the intrinsic features of the relevant objects. So any change in spatial
features is due to some change in the intrinsic, non-relational features
of the object. In brief, Kant's 1698 argument against Leibnizian
relationalism says that incongruent counterparts like left and right
hands are intrinsically exactly similar. This means that their
orientation in space cannot be due to their 'internal' intrinsic,
non-relational features, but must rather be due to something else---viz.
their relation to some absolute space which contains them.

Kant's 1770 argument takes up this point and applies it to our representation
of space. If, Kant argues, our representation of space were ultimately purely
intellectual/conceptual (as Kant construes the Leibnizian to argue), then we
should be able, by means of concepts alone, to distinguish incongruent
counterparts. But, he argues, conceptual representation of (e.g.) a left and a
right hand will not differ since such counterparts do not differ (let us
suppose) in any qualitatively intrinsic way (e.g. neither figure nor internal
angles would differ), nor in any quantitative way (they differ not according
to size, etc.). So since there is no intrinsic difference between the two
hands, there is nothing conceptually to distinguish one as the left and the
other as the right. We must represent their difference by some other means,
which Kant argue is by means of intuition.

The /Prolegomena/'s use of the argument to conclude that consideration of
incongruent counterparts demonstrates that space is ideal is deeply contested.
The conclusion is not the only thing that is contested, unfortunately, for it
is not at all clear how the argument for it goes. The relevant passage is below:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If two things are fully the same (in all determinations belonging to
  magnitude and quality) in all the parts of each that can always be
  cognized by itself alone, it should indeed then follow that one, in
  all cases and respects, can be put in the place of the other, without
  this exchange causing the least recognizable difference. In fact this
  is how things stand with plane figures in geometry; yet various
  spherical figures, notwithstanding this sort of complete inner
  agreement, nonetheless reveal such a difference in outer relation that
  one cannot in any case be put in the place of the other; e.g., two
  spherical triangles from each of the hemispheres, which have an arc of
  the equator for a common base, can be fully equal with respect to
  their sides as well as their angles, so that nothing will be found in
  either, when it is fully described by itself, that is not also in the
  description of the other, and still one cannot be put in the place of
  the other (that is, in the opposite hemisphere); and here is then
  after all an /inner/ difference between the triangles that no
  understanding can specify as inner, and that reveals itself only
  through the outer relation in space...What indeed can be more similar
  to, and in all parts more equal to, my hand or my ear than its image
  in the mirror? And yet I cannot put such a hand as is seen in the
  mirror in the place of its original; for if the one was a right hand,
  then the other in the mirror is a left, and the image of the right ear
  is a left one, which can never take the place of the former. Now there
  are no inner differences here that any understanding could merely
  think; and yet the differences are inner as far as the senses teach,
  for the left hand cannot, after all, be enclosed within the same
  boundaries as the right (they cannot be made congruent), despite all
  reciprocal equality and similarity; one hand's glove cannot be used on
  the other. What then is the solution? These objects are surely not
  representations of things as they are in themselves, and as the pure
  understanding would cognize them, rather, they are sensory intuitions,
  i.e., appearances, whose possibility rests on the relation of certain
  things, unknown in themselves, to something else, namely our
  sensibility. Now, space is the form of outer intuition of this
  sensibility, and the inner determination of any space is possible only
  through the determination of the outer relation to the whole space of
  which the space is a part (the relation to outer sense); that is, the
  part is possible only through the whole, which never occurs with
  things in themselves as objects of the understanding alone, but does
  occur with mere appearances. We can therefore make the difference
  between similar and equal but nonetheless incongruent things (e.g.,
  oppositely spiralled snails) intelligible through no concept alone,
  but only through the relation to right-hand and left-hand, which
  refers immediately to intuition. (Pr §13, 4:285-6)
#+END_QUOTE

One possible reading of the argument (cf. @vancleve1999, 47) goes as
follows:

1. Incongruent counterparts are different in virtue of their differing
   relations to space as a whole.
2. All relations among things in themselves are reducible to the
   nonrelational qualities of the relata.
3. Therefore, if space and figures within it are things in themselves,
   one incongruent counterpart must differ internally from the other.
4. But, in fact, the counterparts do not differ internally.
5. \therefore Space itself and incongruent counterpart figures within it
   are not things in themselves.

According to this interpretation of Kant's argument, Kant's key move is with
premise (2), which we might call the 'Reducibility premise'. The idea here is
that, according to many philosophers with whose views Kant was engaged (such
as Leibniz), differences between distinct objects (or substances) were
supposed to be grounded in differences between the intrinsic features of those
objects. Here we see a connection to Kant's 1698 argument. The Reducibility
premise requires that spatial differences like left-handedness ground out in
intrinsic differences between left and right hands. But there are no such
differences (and the same goes for other kinds of incongruent counterparts) so
space and the things in it must not be things in themselves, or more simply,
they must not be real mind-independent things.

This argument may be successful, or at least valid. But there are worries
about ascribing it to Kant. First, premise (2) is not explicitly stated in the
Kant's text. Second, we need not appeal to space as a whole in the argument.
All we need is that the 'handedness' of the incongruent counterparts need not
reduce to their internal features, whatever their relation to space as a
whole. Third, it is not even necessary to point to /incongruent/ counterparts.
Such elements of the argument are wholly dispensable. All the argument needs
is for there to be some set of relations that are not reducible to their
relata. There are many spatial relations, such as distance, which do not seem
to so reduce. So why then, if this was Kant's view, did he focus on
incongruent counterparts?

It's obvious that Kant put great stock in the argument from incongruent
counterparts, and used it to push a variety of different conclusions.
Unfortunately it is not obvious exactly what the argument is supposed to be,
nor how the fact of such incongruent counterparts could entail three such
different conclusions---viz. that space is absolute, intuitive, and ideal.

# NOTE: these notes have been superseded by the notes in the notebook/lectures

Sections 9-12 of the first chapter of the Analytic of Concepts form what is
typically called the "Metaphysical Deduction"---a name which Kant applies only
later in the /Critique/ (see B159). The purpose of this section is to argue
that of the a priori concepts we have available to us some are more
fundamental than others. These are the concepts Kant calls the "categories."
Thus, the basic question that Kant seeks to answer is the question of /which/ a
priori concepts serve as the fundamental concepts of metaphysical theorizing.
The MD provides what Kant calls a "clue" (or more literally a "/Leitfaden/" or
"guiding thread") to the discovery of these concepts. The MD has three
sections. These consist of (i) an introduction where the notion of a "logical
use" of the faculty of concepts or the "understanding" is set out; (ii) an
elaboration of the different logical forms of judgment and a corresponding
table of those forms; (iii) an explication of the categories as a priori
concepts that correspond to the various logical forms of the table as set out
in (ii).

Kant's strategy in the ME is to argue that the categories are the most
fundamental concepts in our thought of objects because they are the concepts
that are directly linked to the various basic operations of which the
understanding (the faculty of concepts) is capable. Such operations are all
forms of "judgment", and Kant construes such forms as providing the basis for
determining the categories. In order that we properly appreciate why Kant
chooses this strategy for butressing his choice of categories it helps to look
at a prior attempt Kant makes for determining the basic concepts of
metaphysics.

*** The Pre-Critical Strategy 

In Kant's "Inaugural Dissertation" of 1770 (whose formal title is "On the
Forms and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World") he lays out a
theory of the manner in which the structure of the rational human mind
determines what it can know of reality. In many ways this work anticipates
positions and arguments Kant provides in the /Critique of Pure Reason/. And like
that latter work, in the ID Kant seeks to delimit the fundamental concepts of
metaphysics (though he does not in the ID call them categories) via an
analysis of the faculty of understanding (or "intellect" more broadly). He
says,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  the concepts met with in metaphysics are not to be sought in the
  senses but in the very nature of the pure understanding, and that not
  as innate concepts but as concepts abstracted from the laws inherent
  in the mind (by attending to its actions on the occasion of an
  experience), and therefore as acquired concepts. (ID §8, 2:395; see
  also ID Corollary, 2:406 and ID §23, 2:411)
#+END_QUOTE

Here Kant articulates (or perhaps "gestures at" is more accurate) his view of
how the concepts of metaphysics, through which we think of the intelligible
world, are acquired. They are acquired by attending to the actions of the mind
in course of its having experience. Here it is important for Kant's project in
the /Dissertation/, as it will be for his project in the /Critique of Pure
Reason/, that his account of the acquisition of the concepts of metaphysics not
run afoul of his characterization of those concepts as "intellectual" rather
than "empirical" or "sensitive."[fn:48] For this reason they cannot be
concepts abstracted from sensible intuition, in the manner that our concepts
of space and time are. If they /were/ abstracted from experience such concepts
would be (merely) empirical or "sensitive on account of their genesis" (ID §5,
2:393). Instead, the concepts of metaphysics are supposed to be "given in a
fundamental fashion by the pure understanding itself" (ID §23, 2:411). There
is, however, some question as to whether, in the /Dissertation/ or even in
lectures immediately subsequent to its publication, Kant in fact succeeds in
providing an account of the acquisition of the fundamental concepts of
metaphysics consistent with his stricture on their intellectual provenance.

The account of the /Dissertation/ requires that Kant provide some story as to
how we can come to be aware of the mind and its acts, and on what basis this
awareness constitutes the acquisition of a non-sensory concept. At this point
in his career, Kant has not yet articulated his doctrine of "pure"
apperception as distinct from inner sense (more on this in the next set of
notes). So it looks as if, given his distinction between intuition and concept
and their related faculties, that it must be an /inner intuition/ that accounts
for the acquisition of the concepts of metaphysics. However, if it /is/ inner
intuition that is the basis for such acquisition, it looks like Kant will run
afoul of his requirement that the concepts of metaphysics be intellectual as
opposed to empirical (for even the "pure" concepts of space and time, though
free of sensation, are nevertheless /sensitive/ on account of being derived from
intuition (see, e.g., ID §5, 2:393)).

Perhaps Kant thinks we have a special /intellectual/ intuition of the mind and
its acts? One recent commentator [@dyck2016] has argued that Kant is committed
in the /Dissertation/ to our having intellectual intuitions of our own minds and
that he only subsequently, in the later 70s, rejects this position in favor of
one according to which it is inner /sense/---and thus empirical
psychology---that provides the requisite basis for acquiring metaphysical
concepts. Dyck's argument concerning Kant's position in the /Dissertation/
hinges on two claims. First, that there are clear texts showing that Kant
denies that sensible laws (i.e. of time and space) apply to immaterial
substances, including the mind/soul [see @dyck2016, 330]. Second, that Kant's
conception of the acquisition of the pure concepts of metaphysics depends on
the existence of intellectual intuition of the mind or soul itself
[see @dyck2016, 330-1]. However, neither of these interpretive points are
particularly compelling. Against the first, it is relatively clear from the
context of Kant's statements regarding immaterial substance that he denies
that the principles of the /corporeal/ world apply to such substances (ID §27,
2:414). That would mean that principles belonging to substances understood as
/bodies/ do not apply to the mind. But this is compatible with the conception of
the mind as nevertheless governed by other sensible principles, and in
particular, by time. Against Dyck's second point, in the /Dissertation/ Kant
explicitly states that finite beings lack intellectual intuition (ID §10,
2:396-7) and that "the accidents which are not included in the relations of
space, such as the thoughts of the mind" are in time (ID Corollary, 2:406). It
thus seems unlikely that Kant holds in the /Dissertation/ that metaphysical
concepts are acquired via intellectual intuition, on pain of explicitly
contradicting himself at multiple points.[fn:49]

But even if Kant does not directly contradict himself in the /Dissertation/,
Dyck's discussion helps point us to a clear tension and perhaps fatal
ambiguity in Kant's pre-critical view. One might, therefore, have hope that
Kant's remarks in lectures and notes subsequent to the publication of the
/Dissertation/ clarify his position. However, the lecture texts we have from the
1770s only make matters more complicated. For example, in lectures shortly
after the /Dissertation/ Kant says, "We have no intuition in the whole world
except the intuition of our self; all other things are appearances"
(/Anthropologie Collins/ 25:15 (1772-3)). Kant's point here is /not/ that we have
only one intuition---viz. of ourselves. Rather, it is that all of our /outer/
intuitions are of appearances, while our inner (and non-intellectual!)
intuitions present ourselves as /substantial subjects/. In a reflexion also from
the early-to-mid 1770s Kant says that "The I is the intuition of a substance"
(R4493, 17:571 (1772-5)). In the /Metaphysics L_{1}/ lectures, from roughly the
same period, Kant contrasts consciousness of external objects with
consciousness of the self. One intuits oneself immediately, but the same is
not true of external objects (28:206-7, 224). The self (as intelligence) so
intuited is substantial, simple, and immaterial (28:224-5).

In a note (R4674) from the /Duisberg Nachlass/ of 1775-6, Kant writes that an
(external) object may be represented only "according to its relations", i.e.,
only according to the properties, and relations between those properties, that
are presented in sense experience.[fn:50] And, as he does in the
lecture material cited above, Kant /contrasts/ our position with respect to
intuition of external objects with the special access we have to ourselves.
The inner intuition of oneself is of an object whose properties are not
presented, as outer things are, merely in terms of relations.[fn:51]
The language Kant uses in R4674 is also echoed in other texts from the
mid-70s, For example, Kant states that the 'I' is the "original concept" of
substance which we "borrow" for use in our conception of other substances
(/Metaphysics L_{1}/, 28:225-6). Relatedly, he remarks that "the I expresses the
substantial; for that substrate in which all accidents inhere is the
substantial. This is the only case where we can immediately intuit the
substance" (/Pölitz Metaphysik/ 28:226 (1777-80)).

The view that emerges from these texts, and that may in fact already be
present in Kant's /Dissertation/, is one according to which inner sense provides
a privileged epistemic relation to oneself. In inner sense one is presented
not merely as a set of relations, as in outer sense, but as a /subject/ of
properties, as what Kant sometimes describes as an intelligence or "thinking
substance" (e.g. /Metaphysics L_{1}/ 28:224-5). The self is thus the "original
of all objects" in the sense that, as Allison Laywine puts it, "we somehow
transfer our representations of the one true subject and apply it derivatively
or by analogy to our thought of anything else."[fn:52]

Unfortunately, Kant never clarifies how this position concerning the
privileged and peculiar role of inner sense is consistent with his general
doctrine of sensible intuition, or how it is consistent with the
/Dissertation's/ position that no pure intellectual concept can be derived from
the content of sensible intuition. The overall impression of Kant's position
based on his remarks in the Dissertation, and subsequently in the lectures, is
that of a steadfast commitment to roughly the following position.
Introspection provides a form of intuitive acquaintance with the self as a
metaphysical subject, and it is via this acquaintance that we can then form by
analogy the representations of objects (construed as metaphysical subjects of
properties) distinct from us. But how this position is ultimately supposed to
cohere with Kant's other commitments in the 70s is, at best, unclear. It in
facts seems a reasonable suspicion that Kant's various commitments in the 70s
/don't/ cohere, and that this resulting tension in his view is part of what
pushes him towards the critical distinction between inner intuition and pure
apperception. We'll talk about this distinction further when we discuss the
argument of the Transcendental Deduction. In the next section I talk about
Kant's revision of his /Dissertation/ strategy in the /Critique/ for the argument
of the MD.

[fn:48] What are the "concepts of metaphysics" for Kant? Certainly they
        include the concept =<God>=, as well as =<soul>= and =<world>=.
        These all presuppose possession of the concept =<substance>=.
        Presumably also on the list are other concepts one would find
        in, e.g., Baumgarten's /Metaphysica/, such as =<possibility>=,
        =<necessity>=, =<accident>=, and so forth.

[fn:49] For consideration of the problem of self-consciousness in the 1770s
        more broadly, as well as Kant's rejection of intellectual intuition,
        see [@klemme1996, 118-26]. As [@mohr1995, 32-6] points out, Kant does
        speak of an intellectual (not inner) intuition of freedom in
        /reflexionen/ from the early-to-mid-1770s (e.g. R4336 17:509 (1769-75))
        But Kant also speaks of apperception as opposed to intuition in the
        mid-1770s (e.g. R4723 17:688 (1773-5); R6860 19:183 (1776?-91?)). It
        is clear that he is struggling to express the nature of the awareness
        we can have, as rational beings, of our own activity (e.g. R4220
        17:462 (1769-70)).

        entirely of relations, or relational properties, see
        [@pereboom1991; @langton1998; -@langton2006; @mclear2017].

[fn:51] There is also indication in the /Duisburg Nachlaß/, as there was
        in Kant's lectures, of his endorsement of the rational
        psychology he would later come to criticize. For example, in the
        /Nachlaß/ Kant says that "I would not represent anything as
        outside of me and thus make appearance into experience
        (objectively) if the representations did not relate to something
        /that is parallel to my I/, through which I refer them from
        myself to another subject" (R4675, 17:648 (1775); my emphasis).

*** The Critical Strategy

In the /Dissertation/ Kant distinguishes between what he terms the "logical" and
the "real" uses of the understanding (ID §23, 2:410–11). He says,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
in pure philosophy, such as metaphysics, the use of the understanding in
dealing with principles is real; that is to say, the fundamental concepts of
things and of relations, and the axioms themselves, are given in a fundamental
fashion by the pure understanding itself; and, since they are not intuitions,
they are not immune to error. 
#+END_QUOTE

In the first /Critique/ Kant maintains the view that the concepts of metaphysics
come from the understanding. However, he significantly alters the method by
which these concepts are derived. Specifically he now closely links the
categories with the logical forms of judgment. The latter are not just a
"clue" to the organization of the table of categories, they /are/ the
categories, at least in their "logical" use. The central texts making this
plain are as follows.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The same understanding, therefore, and indeed by means of the very same
  actions through which it brings the logical form of a judgment into
  concepts...also brings a transcendental content into its representations by
  means of the synthetic unity of the manifold in intuition in general...(MD
  §10, B105)

  [The categories] are concepts of an object in general, by means of
  which its intuition is regarded as determined with regard to one of
  the logical functions for judgments. (TD Transition, B128)

  That action of the understanding...through which the manifold of given
  representations (whether they be intuitions or concepts) is brought
  under an apperception in general, is the logical function of
  judgments. ... But now the categories are nothing other than these
  very functions for judging, insofar as the manifold of a given
  intuition is determined with regard to them (TD §20, B143)

  In the metaphysical deduction the origin of the a priori categories in
  general was established through their complete coincidence [/völlige
  Zusammentreffung/] with the universal logical functions of thinking
  (TD §26, B159)

  the pure concepts of the understanding are, of themselves, nothing but
  logical functions, but that as such they do not constitute the least
  concept of an object in itself but rather need sensory intuition as a
  basis, and even then they serve only to determine empirical judgments
  (Pr §39, 4:324)
#+END_QUOTE


These texts communicate two important points. First, they indicate Kant's
pursuit of a strategy for explaining how the pure categories, or fundamental
concepts of metaphysics, arise from the intellect. This strategy avoids
commitment to any form of content nativism, and it avoids the problem that we
saw plagued Kant's account in the /Dissertation/---viz. explaining how the pure
categories are "pure" in the sense of being traceable only to the intellect,
without thereby implicating either intellectual intuition, which he denies, or
sensible (inner) intuition, which would undermine their claim to purity.

Pursuit of this strategy means that, second, the very logical functions for
combining representations (concepts) in judgment, and which constitute the
basis of study in what Kant calls "pure general logic", are also the functions
for combining representations (intuitions) in our experience of objects. Thus
for the understanding as a faculty of judging (A69/B94), each logical function
of thinking (e.g. categorical judgment), when applied to a multiplicity of
intuitions, results in a distinctive way of relating to, or "experiencing" in
Kant's technical sense, an object e.g. a substance.

Thus, Kant has a much more coherent strategy than he did in the /Dissertation/
for explaining how we come to grasp the a priori concepts necessary for doing
metaphysics. The notion that we can analyze our logic and determine which are
the basic logical forms is plausible and does not require appealing to some
privileged access we might have to ourselves in introspection (i.e. inner
sense). 

However, for this strategy to ultimately succeed, Kant must provide
substantial arguments for several controversial claims. First, he must show
that he has successfully given a complete analysis of the logical forms of
judgment; second, he must show that the metaphysical concepts derived from
these logical forms (i.e. the categories) really provide the complete basis
for doing metaphysics; third, he must show that the content of the categories
does not include material absent from the purely logical forms---if there
were such "extra" content in the categories, then it is not clear how they are
supposed to be "identical" with the logical forms, as Kant sometimes indicates
that they are.

Unfortunately Kant fails to meet any of these requirements in the MD. There is
no formal demonstration of the completeness of either the table of judgment
or, correspondingly, the categories. There is likewise no demonstration
provided that shows that all and only these categories provide the basic
materials for metaphysics. Finally, it is not obvious that the content of the
categories is simply "identical" with that of the forms of judgment.

To take just one example, Kant construes the category of substance as related
to the form of categorical (i.e. subject/predicate) judgment. The purely
logical or grammatical notion is thus of a term or concept that can only
occupy subject position and never predicate position. However, this notion
does not adequately capture central ways in which Kant uses the concept
<substance>. More specifically, Kant construes a substance as substanding and
subsisting. This means that (i) substance is a being in which things "/inhere/"
and (ii) substance does not itself inhere in anything else (in this
circumscribed sense substance is an independent being). Kant construes
inherence as a real (that is, non-logical) asymmetric dependence relation
between a subject of inherence (the substance) and its properties or modes
(i.e. the way or ways in which the subject exists). The purely logical or
grammatical conception of substance as a subject term that is never a
predicate term fails to properly capture this dependence relation, for it
fails to show how a predicate term might asymmetrically depend on a subject
term in a manner that models the metaphysical relation between substance and
mode.

In the end then, while Kant's strategy in the MD is a clear improvement over
his prior attempt in the /Dissertation/, it is not at all clear that he
successfully defends his claim to have provided a principled and a priori
basis for exhaustively determining which are the fundamental concepts. Kant
wants an argument that,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
has not arisen rhapsodically from a haphazard search for pure concepts, of the completeness of which one could never be certain, since one would only infer it through induction, without reﬂecting that in this way one would never see why just these and not other concepts should inhabit the pure understanding. (A81/B106-7)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant does not provide convincing proof of this position in the MD. Whether such a proof could be given is, perhaps, another story.[fn:53]

[fn:53] There are a variety of prominent attempts to defend Kant's position
here. See [@reich1992; @brandt1995; @wolff1995; @longuenesse1998].

*** The Problem with A Priori Concepts

Kant's mature philosophical system is notable for the strictures it sets on the kind of cognition and knowledge human beings (or finite rational beings more generally) can achieve through reason alone. Importantly, Kant thinks that pure reason can achieve relatively little on its own. All of our ampliative knowledge that is also necessary and universal consists in what Kant calls ‘synthetic a priori' judgments or propositions. The central question he then pursues concerns how knowledge of such synthetic a priori propositions is possible. [[https://phil871.colinmclear.net/notes/transcendental-aesthetic][We previously discussed]] Kant's arguments concerning the role (the representations of) space and time play in grounding necessary and universal mathematical cognition and knowledge. On Kant's view, mathematical cognition is synthetic because it goes beyond mere conceptual analysis to deal with the structure of (our representation of) space itself. It is a priori because the structure of (our representation of) space is a priori accessible to us, being merely the form of our intuition and not a real mind independent thing (i.e. a ‘thing in itself').

However, recall from our discussion of [[https://phil871.colinmclear.net/notes/kant-copernican-revolution/#transcendental-idealism][transcendental idealism]] that, in addition to the representation of space and time, Kant also thinks that possession of a particular privileged set of a priori concepts is necessary for knowledge of the empirical world. But this raises a problem. How could an a priori concept, which is not itself derived from any experience, be nevertheless legitimately applicable to objects of experience? To make things even more difficult, it is not the mere possibility of the application of a priori concepts to objects of experience that worries Kant, for this could just be a matter of pure luck. Kant requires more than the mere possibility of application, for he wants to show that with regard to a privileged set of a priori concepts, they apply necessarily and universally to all objects of experience and do so in a way that we are in a position to know a priori.

Kant's strategy for demonstrating how this is possible hinges on showing that the experience of objects that he thinks all would agree that we have nevertheless depends on the application of a priori concepts---the categories. Kant makes this clear in his elaboration of his ‘Copernican Turn' in philosophy:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
because I cannot stop with these intuitions, if they are to become cognitions, but must refer them as representations to something as their object and determine this object through them, I can assume either that the concepts through which I bring about this determination also conform to the objects, and then I am once again in the same difficulty about how I could know anything about them /a priori/, or else I assume that the objects, or what is the same thing, the /experience/ in which alone they can be cognized (as given objects) conforms to those concepts, in which case I immediately see an easier way out of the difficulty, since experience itself is a kind of cognition requiring the understanding, whose rule I have to presuppose in myself before any object is given to me, hence /a priori/, which rule is expressed in concepts /a priori/, to which all objects of experience must therefore necessarily conform, and with which they must agree. (CPR Preface, Bxvii)
#+END_QUOTE

Kant's strategy is thus to show how a priori concepts legitimately apply to their objects in virtue of being partly constitutive of the objects of experience, rather than the traditional view in which the objects of experience are the ground of our concepts. Now, what exactly this means is deeply contested, at least partly because it is rather unclear what Kant intends us to understand by his Transcendental Idealism. For example, does Kant intend that the objects of experience are /themselves/ nothing other than representations? This would be a form of phenomenalism similar to that offered by [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/][Berkeley]]. Kant, however, seems to want to deny that his view is similar to Berkeley's, asserting instead that the objects of experience really exist independently of the mind, and that it is only the /way/ that they are experienced that is mind-dependent.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
the fact that I have myself given to this theory of mine the name of
transcendental idealism cannot justify anyone in confusing it with the
empirical idealism of /Descartes/ (although this idealism was only a problem,
whose insolubility left everyone free, in /Descartes/' opinion, to deny the
existence of the corporeal world, since the problem could never be answered
satisfactorily) or with the mystical and visionary idealism of /Berkeley/
(against which, along with other similar fantasies, our /Critique/, on the
contrary, contains the proper antidote). For what I called idealism did not
concern the existence of things (the doubting of which, however, properly
constitutes idealism according to the received meaning), for it never came
into my mind to doubt that, but only the sensory representation of things, to
which space and time above all belong; and about these last, hence in general
about all /appearances/, I have only shown: that they are not things (but mere
ways of representing), nor are they determinations that belong to things in
themselves. (/Prolegomena/ §13, Note III; 4:293)
#+END_QUOTE

I'm mostly going to set this issue to the side in what follows. But the issue of idealism is important to consider, insofar as Kant takes himself to be replying to Hume's arguments about the nature of the empirical world and the nature and extent of our knowledge of it.


*** What Is a Transcendental Deduction?

In order to prove that there are a priori concepts which legitimately apply to the objects of experience, Kant articulates [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental/][a special sort of argument]], which he calls a 'transcendental deduction'. As @henrich1989 points out, the notion of a 'deduction' that Kant uses, is a legal one intended to provide a historical justification for the legitimacy of a property claim. In Kant's case however, it is transformed into a justification of the applicability (in the sense discussed above) of the a priori concepts Kant calls the 'categories'. These are the concepts given in Kant's 'Table of Categories' (A80/B106); they are Unity, Plurality, and Totality (the Categories of Quantity); Reality, Negation, and Limitation (the Categories of Quality); Inherence and Subsistence, Causality and Dependence, and Community (the Categories of Relation), and Possibility-Impossibility, Existence-Nonexistence, Necessity-Contingency (the Categories of Modality).

With regard to each category, Kant's aim is to show that it has 'objective validity'---i.e. legitimate applicability to the objects of experience. Disputes concerning various members of the table should be familiar. Hume famously disputes the legitimacy of our concept /cause/. Hume thinks (in Kant's terms) that no 'empirical deduction' of the concept is possible---i.e. that the concept cannot be traced to the occurrence of a corresponding impression. Kant concurs with Hume on this point---that there can be no empirical deduction---but argues that this doesn't show that the concept is illegitimate, for it may be both a priori and legitimately applied in virtue of being a necessary condition of experience.

For Kant then a 'transcendental deduction' starts from a premise concerning some feature of human experience, a premise which reasonable interlocutors might be expected to endorse, and then argues to a substantive philosophical conclusion concerning the presuppositions or necessary conditions of the truth of that premise. Since Kant's concern here is the a priori categories, his aim is to show that a presupposition or necessary condition of some relatively uncontroversial feature of experience is the applicability (or successful application) of the a priori concept(s) in question to the objects of experience. Below we'll concern ourselves with Kant's answer to Hume regarding the objective legitimacy of the concept /cause/.

*** Experience & Cognition
Kant is concerned with how we might explain and justify the application of a priori concepts to objects of experience. But this question, as it stands, requires still sharper focus. We've seen what Kant means in his question concerning the /legitimacy/ of concepts in their application to the objects of experience. But what does Kant mean by "/experience/" [/Erfahrung/]? Our problem is that the notion of "experience," both in German and in English, is ambiguous and can mean any number of a variety of things---anything from the mere occurrence of sensation all the way to empirical judgment.[fn:54]

For Kant, "experience" is a technical term that is closely related to /empirical cognition/ [/empirische Erkenntniss/]. He makes this clear at several points, both in the Deduction and elsewhere in the first /Critique/. However, in what exactly the relation between the two notions consists is somewhat problematic. For example, Kant says that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Such cognitions [i.e. those that are independent of any sense impression] are called /a priori/ cognitions; they are distinguished from empirical cognitions, /whose sources are a posteriori, namely, in experience/ [/Erfahrung/] (Introduction, B2; my emphasis).
#+END_QUOTE

Here we see Kant saying that the /source/ of empirical cognition is experience. However, Kant also quite explicitly /identifies/ empirical cognition with experience (or treats the terms synonymously).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Empirical cognition, however, is experience (B166).

Experience is an empirical cognition, i.e., a cognition that determines an object through perceptions (A176/B218).

Therefore experience itself---i.e., empirical cognition of appearances---is possible only inasmuch as we subject the succession of appearances, and hence all change, to the law of causality (A189/B234).

it [the presentation "I am"] is not yet a cognition of that subject, and hence is also no empirical cognition -- i.e., experience -- of it (B277).
#+END_QUOTE

These passages all identify experience with empirical cognition. But if they are
synonymous notions then how could experience be the /source/ of empirical cognition, as
is said in B2? A relatively simple resolution of this problem is to distinguish two
notions of "experience"---between "experience" as the sensory result of affection by
external objects (via outer sense) and oneself (via inner sense) and "experience" as
the result of structuring sense perceptions via the categories. Call the latter,
categorically structured state, "complex experience" (or "C-experience") and the
former state "simple experience" (or S-experience). We can then read B2 as saying
that empirical cognition, which is identical with C-experience, has its source in
S-experience, the material (sensation, intuition, perception) out of which complex
experience is constructed.

This also helps us make sense of B1, where Kant says,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There is no doubt whatever that all our cognition begins with experience; for how else should the cognitive faculty be awakened into exercise if not through objects that stimulate our senses and in part themselves produce representations, in part bring the activity of our understanding into motion to compare these, to connect or separate them, and thus to work up the raw material of sensible impressions into /a cognition of objects that is called experience/? (my emphasis)
#+END_QUOTE

All cognition begins with /simple/ experience, which is "worked up" into cognition of objects (i.e. empirical cognition) or (as I've called it) complex experience. 

In §17 of the B-deduction Kant specifies that a cognition consists in the "determinate relation of given representations to an object" (B137). I take this to mean that S-experience---the contents of a sensory intuition---provides consciousness of 'appearances' [/Erscheinungen/] or 'undetermined objects' [/unbestimmte Gegestande/] (A20/B34)---which is then made 'determinate' via the activity of the intellect. The result is /empirical/ cognition of an object. And it is this empirical cognition of objects (and ultimately all cognition of objects whatsoever) that it is the aim of Kant's Deduction to legitimate, for it is this cognition that depends on the categories.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
all empirical cognition of objects necessarily conforms to such concepts [i.e. the categories], because nothing is possible as object of experience unless these concepts are presupposed A93/B126).
#+END_QUOTE

Hence, to show that the categories are "objectively valid" or legitimate in their application to any and all objects of possible experience, is for Kant to show that the categories are necessary for empirical cognition of objects, or complex experience. One thing to think about as we move through the argument of the Deduction is whether Kant's conception of C-experience corresponds to anything in the positions of empiricists like Locke and Hume. Do empiricists need to concede the existence of the kind of experience for which Kant thinks the categories are necessary?[fn:55]

Kant's demonstration of the validity of the categories attempts to wind its way
between two poles which he terms the /enthusiasm/ of Locke and the /skepticism/
of Hume (A94/B127). Locke's enthusiasm lay in the attempted derivation of all
our concepts from the structure of appearances (whether we interpret these
appearances as objects or merely as ideas). But this derivation is, according
to Kant, inconsistent with the conditions for the manifestation of appearances
and led us to improperly apply our concepts beyond their sphere.

In contrast to Locke, Hume denies that the a priori concepts have any
application whatsoever, and thus Hume presents a sort of skeptical alternative
to Locke. Kant's third way argues that the structure of C-experience and the
structure of our concepts are interconnected. His strategy for showing this is
to show that the structure of C-experience and the structure of propositional
judgment have a common root---viz. the unifying activity of the understanding.
The Transcendental Deduction is thus an attempt "to try to find out whether we
cannot provide for human reason safe passage between these two cliffs, assign
to it determinate bounds, and yet keep open for it the entire realm of its
appropriate activity" (A95/B128). How exactly Kant does this requires
explication of the first step of the Deduction, to which we'll now turn.

        kinds of experience in [@beck1978c] and the sources cited therein.

*** Structure of the Deduction
I take the structure of the deduction to consist of two steps; the first starts at §15 and concludes with §20 (§21 being essentially a recap of the preceding argument). The second step begins with §22 and concludes with §26 (with §27 also being a recapitulation). This "two-step" interpretation is not new, though interpretation of the content of each step and their relations to one another differs widely.[fn:56]

The first step of the Deduction (§§15-21) argues that /combination/ of representations
cannot be given to the subject via the senses, but is rather something that the
subject does. In order that the combination of representations result in cognition,
Kant then argues that there must be a unitary subject, or /combiner/ of those
representations. The unity condition is satisfied by what Kant calls, in §16, the "original synthetic unity of apperception." In the next three sections (§§17-19) Kant argues that this unity of apperception requires a kind of activity, and that this activity is fundamentally that of the functions of the understanding or the "categories."  He concludes in §20 that (i) since all complex unities require combination; (ii) combination requires the original synthetic unity of apperception; and (iii) the unity of apperception is or essentially requires a kind of categorial activity; that (iv) all (complex) unity, including intuition, depends on, or "stands under" (B143) the categories.    

The second step of the Deduction (§§22-7) discusses both positive and negative points raised by the first step. Negatively, Kant argues that the categories are limited to /empirical cognition/ -- i.e. to the cognition of appearances, not things in themselves. This importantly includes even our cognition of /ourselves/ as subjects of consciousness. Positively, Kant argues in §26 that not only does all cognition rest on the application of the categories, but that one and all, appearances /are necessarily/ categorial. He does this be showing that (i) we have a priori cognition of space and time themselves as objects, (ii) that this is only possible via the categories, (iii) and that since all appearances are governed by space and time, any appearance in space and time must also be categorially structured. This means that there is no possibility of an object's appearing (i.e. being "given) that is not susceptible to determination by the categories. If this argument is successful then Kant will have demonstrated both that if we have cognition ("experience" in Kant's technical sense) then it depends on the categories, and that we /do/ have such cognition, since mathematical cognition preuspposes that we cognize space and time as objects. 

[fn:56] The /locus classicus/ for the two-step interpretation is [@henrich1969]. Note that I am not endorsing any of the specifics of Henrich's account, e.g., that the second step of the Deduction consists in the comparatively trivial reminder that since human forms of intuition are spatio-temporal, the categories must be know to apply only to spatio-temporal objects.

*** The Analogies   
Kant entitles the section of the System of All Principles discussing the relational categories the "Analogies of Experience." Kant discusses the category of /cause/ in the second of his three ‘Analogies'. The Analogies are part of the ‘Analytic of Principles' in which Kant discusses each of the twelve categories and their relation to the objects of experience at much greater length than he does in the argument of the Transcendental Deduction, where he is concerned with the categories' general relation to objects of experience. Before we go on to discuss Kant's view of causality in detail let's start with a few background issues. First, what does Kant mean here by an "analogy"?

Kant distinguishes between analogy in mathematics and analogy in philosophy (B221) and defines analogy in philosophy as

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
not the identity of two *quantitative* [relations, as in mathematical analogy] but [the identity] of two *qualitative* relations, where from three given members I can cognize and give /a priori/ only the *relation* to a fourth member but not *this* fourth *member* itself, although I have a rule for seeking it in experience and a mark for discovering it there (B222)
#+END_QUOTE

It is not clear from this remark what the fundamental difference is between mathematical and philosophical analogy.[fn:57] He goes on to say that 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
An analogy of experience will therefore be only a rule in accordance with which unity of experience is to arise from perceptions (not as a perception itself, as empirical intuition in general), and as a principle it will not be valid of the objects (of the appearances) *constitutively* but merely *regulatively*. (B222)
#+END_QUOTE

Though Kant's position here is complicated, and interpretations contested, at least this much is clear. First, the paragraph immediately above points out that the relational categories are not constitutive of appearances, intuition, or the perception thereof. They is, they are not the conditions of the possibility of such representations. Instead they are constitutive only of experience, insofar as it can be constructed from the connected series of intuitions in a perception. Second, that there is supposed to be a general structure to the analogies such that a is to b as c is to /x/, where /x/ is that which is to be sought in an experience.

Fortunately, for our purposes, we need not have an exact conception of what an analogy is to appreciate the basic points of his argument in the Second Analogy. But we do need to understand the exact relation between the category <cause-effect> and the representation of time.

Kant distinguishes three different kinds of temporality (B219): persistence, succession, and simultaneity. He then claims that each kind of temporality is connected with each of the relational categories (i.e. persistence with <substance-inherence>, succession with <cause-effect>, and simultaneity with <community>).  

Kant therefore prefaces his discussion of the three Analogies of Experience with a single principle, which, in the first edition, reads: “As regards their existence, all appearances stand a priori under rules of the determination of their relation to each other in one time” (A176) and in the second, reads: “Experience is possible only through the representation of a necessary connection of perceptions” (B218). The basic idea here is that each of the three relational categories represents a necessary connection that is required for the possibility of /experience/ (not intuition or perception!) of (i) a single time and (ii) of objects existing and being temporally related to each other within a single time.

Two further points of background are worth discussing before proceeding to the Second Analogy itself. First, Kant denies that we can perceive time itself (B219), which is to say that Kant denies that we have conscious awareness of /time/, as opposed to the persistence, succession, or simultaneity of representations that occur /in/ time.

Second, Kant assumes a distinction between an objective temporal order between states of objects (and between objects) and the subjective temporal appearance of such order, construed merely as the subjective succession of representations in a particular empirical mind. Much of Kant's discussion is then aimed at answering the question "how do I manage to cognize and know anything about an objective temporal order if all I have access to is the subjective temporal succession of my own representations?"

[fn:57] See [@callanan2008] for extensive discussion and citations.

*** The Second Analogy

The Second Analogy concerns the /cause-effect/ relation. The "unschematized" (i.e. the "pure" and non-temporal) version of the category says that given the existence of some ground, its consequence necessarily exists. But this says nothing further about the relata, the relation between ground and consequence, or the nature of the relation of necessity that holds between them. In the Second Analogy we see the schematized version of the category, and thus the elaboration of the necessary relation as a /temporal/ one. He states this as follows:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  All alterations occur in accordance with the law of the connection of cause
  and effect (B232)
#+END_QUOTE

In other words, all alterations occur lawfully, such that all alterations occur due to causes from which they necessarily follow. 

What is an "alteration"? Kant says that "the concept of alteration presupposes one and the same subject as existing with two opposed determinations, and thus as persisting" (B233). This indicates that Kant is primarily concerned with a change of state in a substance. An alteration is the change of a substance from one state (or the possession of a property) to another, e.g. from hot to cold, thin to fat, black to white, etc. Kant thus seeks to validate the principle that there can be no alteration in a substance that is not due to some cause.   

Kant conceives of all change in terms of alteration. So the Second Analogy ends up being an argument concerned with our ability to cognize change with respect to the objects of experience. Kant's view is that all change with respect to such objects must be understood temporally, and as requiring that the change be the effect of some cause. 

One issue related to this way of setting up the problem of causation is that it is unclear whether the success of the Second Analogy is supposed to show that no alteration takes place except as the result of /some/ cause, or that no alteration takes place except as the result of the /same type/ of cause. The phrasing of the principle supports only the first, weaker reading, but lawful causation is often taken to require that the same type of cause always yields the same type of effect (e.g. fire causes heat). 

A further issue is whether the argument Kant presents for the causal principle ends up being one that engages in any way with Hume's skeptical position concerning causation. Recall that according to Hume we have no impression of necessary connection, and so there cannot be any legitimacy to the use of the concept of necessary connection in our experience of objects. For Hume, casual judgments are the result of being habituated to expect the occurrence of one event given the occurrence of another (e.g. to expect that heat will accompany fire). 

**** The Argument

Much of Kant's argument in the Second Analogy proceeds by way of the following starting point or assumption: We are able to represent (and ultimately come to know) the difference between the subjective succession or simultaneity of our own states, and the objective succession or simultaneity of states in an object. How is this so much as possible?

Understanding Kant's argument in this way suggests that he is engaged in a manner of argumentation that we've termed a "transcendental" argument. That is, an argument that starts from an assumption concerning some actual phenomenon and regresses to the conditions of that actual phenomenon's possibility. Kant provides two examples to motivate this assumption, that of the visual experience of (the parts of) a house, and the experience of a ship moving downriver. We distinguish the representation of a persisting object, such as a house, from a series of events, such as a ship moving downriver. But in both cases there is no difference subjectively in what occurs (at least at a certain level of abstraction), namely a succession of subjective perceptions. As Kant says,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The apprehension of the manifold of appearance is always successive. The representations of the parts succeed one another. Whether they also succeed in the object is a second point for reflection, which is not contained in the first (B234)
#+END_QUOTE

So how is it that we can distinguish in the ship case that we have an objective /succession/ of events, while in the house case we have objective /simultaneity/---one persisting object, whose parts (e.g. roof, walls, windows, etc.) we perceive successively but are in fact simultaneous?

Kant rules out several possibilities. We can't distinguish objective succession from objective simultaneity by the intuition or perception of any necessary connection because (and here Kant agrees with Hume) experience “to be sure tells us what is, but not that it must necessarily be so and not otherwise” (B3). Second, the supposed irreversibility of our perception of successive events (such as with the riverboat case) cannot tell us anything because one can only be aware of the relevant contrast between 'reversible' and 'irreversible' perceptions if one is /already/ aware that there is an irreversible order (e.g. that B's following A and not vice versa) to what one is perceiving, such that one's perceptions must be in accord with it. Third, one cannot appeal to some independently perceivable temporal succession (‘absolute' time), because Kant has already ruled out the possibility of perceiving time itself (B 245). Fourth, one cannot appeal to the perception of any mind-independent object (a ‘thing in itself'), since these too have been ruled out as wholly inaccessible to our conscious awareness.

So Kant has issued a challenge: granted that a subject of experience has a grasp of the distinction between objective succession of alterations in an object (e.g. in the motion of a ship downstream) and the objective simultaneity of the features of an object (e.g. the various features of a house), what accounts for such awareness? This is a problem for the Humean as well, since that view presupposes that we at least sometimes make causal judgments based on a grasp of a determinate temporal sequence (i.e. of some event B following event A).[fn:58] Hence the Humean account of habituation and causal judgment presupposes that we can distinguish the objective sequence of events from our subjective train of sense experiences.

Kant's claim then, is that it is only if there is a rule ordering our representations, such that what makes it possible for us to grasp two events as related by objective temporal succession is that one event /caused/ the other. Here is a reconstruction of the whole argument, as articulated by Georges Dicker (@dicker2004, 173).

1. We cannot know by observation that an event---that is, a transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring by knowing that the perceptions of A and B occur in the order A, B; by knowing that the perceptions of A and B are irreversible; by knowing that A precedes B by reference to absolute time; or by knowing that these perceptions are of successive states of things-in-themselves.
2. If (1), then the only way we can know by perception that an event---that
   is, a transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring is by knowing
   that B follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause.
3. If the only way we can know by perception that an event---that is, a
   transition from a state A to a state B---is occurring is by knowing that B
   follows A according to a rule, that is, that the event has a cause, then
   any event such that we can know of its occurrence by perception must have a
   cause.
4. \therefore Any event such that we can know of its occurrence by perception must
   have a cause.

Kant's conclusion here is limited in several ways. First, it concerns only knowledge that empirical events have causes. It does not say, e.g., that similar events always have similar causes. Second, it presupposes that we have knowledge of the objective succession of events. Third, it presupposes that we correctly grasp the distinction between objective succession and objective simultaneity. But, despite these presuppositions, the argument seems an effective answer to the Humean, for the Humean analysis of causation requires that we have a grasp of objective succession (as well as the distinction between objective simultaneity and succession), for this is used by the Humean to explain how our associative powers get their grip on causal judgment. Hence, while Kant's argument concerning causation may not be effective against all comers, particularly against the skeptic who might deny that we have any cognitive grasp of objective succession, it nevertheless seems effective against Hume's argument.

[fn:58] Note that Kant's argument doesn't obviously affect a version of the Humean view that regards causal judgment as based on habituation due to there /being/ a temporal order amongst our representations. Kant's argument only affects the more robust view that we must /represent/ the temporal order amongst our representations for causal judgment to occur.

Kant discusses the nature and limits of our self-knowledge most extensively in
the first /Critique/, in a section of the [[http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantmeta/#H6][Transcendental Dialectic]] called the
"[[http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantview/#SSH2gi][Paralogisms of Pure Reason]]". Here Kant is concerned to criticize the claims
of what he calls "rational psychology", and specifically, the claim that we
can have substantive metaphysical knowledge of the nature of the subject,
based purely on an analysis of the concept of the thinking self, or as Kant
typically puts it, the =<I think>=.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *I think* is thus the sole text of rational psychology, from which it
  is to develop its entire wisdom...because the least empirical
  predicate would corrupt the rational purity and independence of the
  science from all experience. (A343/B401)
#+END_QUOTE

There are four "Paralogisms". Each argument is presented as a [[http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/#H9][syllogism]], which
consists of two premises and a conclusion. According to Kant, each argument is
guilty of an equivocation on a term common to the premises, such that the
argument is invalid. Kant's aim, in his discussion of each Paralogism, is to
diagnose the equivocation, and explain why the rational psychologist's
argument ultimately fails. In so doing Kant provides a great deal of
information about his own views concerning the mind (See @ameriks2000 for
extensive discussion). The argument of the first Paralogism concerns our
knowledge of the self as substance; the second, the simplicity of the self;
the third, the numerical identity of the self; the fourth, knowledge of the
self versus knowledge of things in space. We'll take these arguments in turn.

*** Substantiality (A348-51/B410-11)

Kant presents the rationalist's argument in the First Paralogism as follows:

1. What cannot be thought otherwise than as subject does not exist
   otherwise than as subject, and is therefore substance.
2. Now a thinking being, considered merely as such, cannot be thought
   otherwise than as subject.
3. \therefore A thinking being also exists only as such a thing, i.e.,
   as substance.

Kant's presentation of the argument is rather compressed. In more explicit
form we can put it as follows (see @proops2010 and @rosefeldt2017a):

1. All entities that cannot be thought otherwise than as subjects are
   entities that cannot exist otherwise than as subjects, and therefore
   (by definition) are substances. (All M are P)
2. All entities that are thinking beings (considered merely as such) are
   entities that cannot be thought otherwise than as subjects. (All S
   are M)
3. \therefore All entities that are thinking beings (considered merely
   as such) are entities that cannot exist otherwise than as subjects,
   and therefore are substances (All S are P)

The relevant equivocation concerns the term that occupies the 'M' place in the argument -- viz. "entities that cannot be thought otherwise than as subjects". Kant specifically locates the ambiguity in the use of the term "thought" [/Das Denken/], which he claims is taken in the first premise to concern an object in general, and thus something that could be given in a possible intuition. In the second premise the use of "thought" is supposed to apply only to a feature of thought and, thus, not to an object of a possible intuition (B411-12).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The major premise talks about a being that can be thought of in every respect,
and consequently also as it might be given in intuition. But the minor premise
talks about this being only insofar as it considers itself as a subject
relatively only to thinking and the unity of consciousness, but not at the
same time in relation to intuition, through which it is given as an object for
thinking. Hence the conclusion is inferred /per sophisma figurae dictionis/, and
hence through a fallacy. (B411)
#+END_QUOTE

The representation ‘I’ has the formal feature of non-predicability---there is no possible thought that features it as a predicate. But this fact is not sufficient for showing that the referent of =<I>= is a subsisting and substanding being. Why not? Because =<I>= can never be applied to such a being on the basis of a sensible intiuition, which could only present the subject as it appears and not as it is in itself. In particular, our sensible intuition in inner sense can present nothing that persists, so it cannot present a persisting soul or absolute subject either (eg. A350). 

Hence, against the rational psychologist, Kant argues that we cannot make any legitimate inference from the conditions under which the representation =<I>= may be thought, or employed in a judgment, to the status of the 'I' as a metaphysical subject of properties. Kant makes this point explicit when he says,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  the first syllogism of transcendental psychology imposes on us an only
  allegedly new insight when it passes off the constant logical subject of
  thinking as the cognition of a real subject of inherence, with which we do
  not and cannot have the least acquaintance, because consciousness is the one
  single thing that makes all representations into thoughts, and in which,
  therefore, as in the transcendental subject, our perceptions must be
  encountered; and apart from this logical significance of the I, we have no
  acquaintance with the subject in itself that grounds this I as a substratum,
  just as it grounds all thoughts. (A350)
#+END_QUOTE

Since, Kant denies that we have any intuition, empirical or otherwise, of
ourselves as subjects, we cannot, merely in reflection on the conditions of
thinking of ourselves using the first-person concept, come to have any
knowledge concerning what we are. No amount of introspection or reflection on
the content of the first-person concept =<I>= will yield such knowledge.

*** Simplicity (A351-61/B407-8)

Kant's discussion of the proposed metaphysical simplicity of the subject
largely depends on points he made in the previous Paralogism concerning its
proposed substantiality. Kant articulate the Second Paralogism as follows:

1. The subject whose action can never be regarded as the concurrence of
   many acting things, is simple. (All A is B)
2. The self is such a subject. (C is A)
3. \therefore The self is simple. (C is B)

Here the equivocation concerns the notion of a "subject". Kant's point, as
with the previous Paralogism, is that, from the fact that one's first-person
representation of the self is always a grammatical or logical subject, nothing
follows concerning the metaphysical status of the referent of that
representation.

Of perhaps greater interest in this discussion of the Paralogism of simplicity
is Kant's analysis of what he calls (in the A-edition) the "Achilles of all
dialectical inferences" (A351). According to the Achilles argument, the soul
or mind is known to be a simple unitary substance because only such a
substance could think unitary thoughts. Call this the "unity claim" (see
@brook1997):

- (UC): :: if a multiplicity of representations are to form a single
  representation, they must be contained in the absolute unity of the
  thinking substance. (A352)

Against UC, Kant argues that we have no reason to think that
the structure of a thought, as a complex of representations, isn't
mirrored in the complex structure of an entity which thinks the thought.
UC is not analytic, which is to say that there is no contradiction
entailed by its negation. UC also fails to be a synthetic a priori
claim, since it follows neither from the nature of the forms of
intuition, nor from the categories. Hence UC could only be shown to be
true empirically, and since we do not have any empirical intuition of
the self, we have no basis for thinking that UC must be true (A353).

Kant here makes a point familiar from contemporary [[http://www.iep.utm.edu/functism/][functionalist]] accounts of
the mind (see @meerbote1991; @brook1997). Our mental functions, including
the unity of conscious thought, are consistent with a variety of different
possible media in which the functions are realized. Kant's point is that there
is no contradiction in thinking that a plurality of substances might succeed
in generating a single unified thought. Hence we cannot know that the mind is
such that it must be simple in nature.

*** Numerical Identity (A361-66/B408)

Kant articulates the Third Paralogism as follows:

1. What is conscious of the numerical identity of its Self in different
   times, is to that extent a person. (All C is P)
2. Now the soul is conscious of the numerical identity of its Self in
   different times. (S is C)
3. \therefore The soul is a person. (S is P)

The interest taken in establishing the personality of the soul or mind by the
rational psychologists, stems from the importance of proving that not only
would the mind persist after the destruction of its body, but also that this
mind would be the same person, and not just some sort of bare consciousness or
worse (e.g. existing only as a "[[http://www.iep.utm.edu/lei-mind/#SH1a][bare monad]]").

Kant here makes two main points. First, the rational psychologist cannot infer
from the sameness of the first-person representation (the "I think"), across
applications of it in judgment, to any conclusion concerning the sameness of
the metaphysical subject referred to by that representation. Kant is thus once
again making a functionalist point that the medium in which a series of
representational states inheres may change over time, and there is no
contradiction in conceiving of a series of representations as being
transferred from one substance to another (A363-4, note).

Second, Kant argues that we can be confident of the soul's possession of
/personality/ in virtue of the persistence of apperception. The relevant notion
of "personality" here is one concerning the contrast between a rational being
and an animal. While the persistence of apperception (i.e. the persistence of
the "I think" as being able to attach to all of one's representations) does
not provide an apperceiving subject with any insight into the true
metaphysical /nature/ of the mind, it does provide evidence of the soul's
possession of an understanding. Animals, by contrast, do not possess an
understanding but, at best (according to Kant), only an analogue thereof. As
Kant says in the /Anthropology/,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  That man can have the I among his representations elevates him infinitely
  above all other living beings on earth. He is thereby a person [...] that is,
  by rank and worth a completely distinct being from things that are the same
  as reason-less animals with which one can do as one pleases. (An 7:127, §1)
#+END_QUOTE

Hence, so long as a soul possesses the capacity for
apperception, it will signal the possession of an understanding, and
thus serves to distinguish the human soul from that of an animal (see
@dyck2010, 120).

*** Relation to Objects in Space (A366-80/B409)

Finally, the Fourth Paralogism (here I primarily discuss the A-edition
version) concerns the relation between our awareness of our own minds and our
awareness of other objects distinct from ourselves, and thus as located in
space. Kant describes the Fourth Paralogism as follows:

1. What can be only causally inferred is never certain. (All I is not C)
2. The existence outer objects can only be causally inferred, not
   immediately perceived by us. (O is I)
3. \therefore We can never be certain of the existence of outer
   objects. (O is not C)

Kant locates the damaging ambiguity in the conception of
"outer" objects. This is puzzling since it doesn't play the relevant
role as middle term in the syllogism. But Kant is quite clear that this
is where the ambiguity lies and distinguishes between two distinct
senses of the "outer" or "external":

- Trancendentally Outer/External: :: a seperate existence, in and of
  itself
- Empirically Outer/External: :: an existence in space

Kant's point here is that all appearances in space are
empirically external to the subject who perceives or thinks about them,
while nevertheless being transcendentally internal, in that such spatial
appearances do not have an entirely independent metaphysical nature,
since their spatial features depend at least in part on our forms of
intuition.

Kant then uses this distinction not only to argue against the assumption of
the rational psychologist that the mind is better known than any object in
space (this a claim famously argued by [[http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/#SH4b][Descartes]]), but also against those
forms of external world skepticism championed by [[http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/#SH8a][Descartes]] and [[http://www.iep.utm.edu/berkeley/#H4][Berkeley]]. Kant
identifies Berkeley with what he calls "dogmatic idealism" and Descartes with
what he calls "problematic idealism" (A377).

- Problematic Idealism: :: we cannot be certain of the existence of any
  material body
- Dogmatic Idealism: :: we can be certain that no material body exists
  -- the notion of a body is self-contradictory

Kant brings two arguments to bear against the rational
psychologist's assumption about the immediacy of our self-knowledge, as
well as these two forms of skepticism, with mixed results. The two
arguments are (what I am calling) the arguments from "immediacy" and
"imagination". We'll take these in turn.

**** i. The Immediacy Argument

In an extended passage in the Fourth Paralogism (A370-1) Kant makes the
following argument:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  external objects (bodies) are merely appearances, hence also nothing
  other than a species of my representations, whose objects are
  something only through these representations, but are nothing
  separated from them. Thus external things exist as well as my self,
  and indeed both exist on the immediate testimony of my
  self-consciousness, only with this difference: the representation of
  my Self, as the thinking subject, is related merely to inner sense,
  but the representations that designate extended beings are also
  related to outer sense. I am no more necessitated to draw inferences
  in respect of the reality of external objects than I am in regard to
  the reality of the objects of my inner sense (my thoughts), for in
  both cases they are nothing but representations, the immediate
  perception (consciousness) of which is at the same time a sufficient
  proof of their reality. (A370-1)
#+END_QUOTE

I take the argument here to be as follows:

1. Rational Psychology (RP) privileges awareness of the subject and its
   states over awareness of non-subjective states.
2. But transcendental idealism entails that we are aware of both
   subjective and objective states, as they appear, /in the same way/ --
   viz. via a form of /intuition/.
3. So either both kinds of awareness are immediate or they are both
   mediate.
4. Since awareness of subjective states is obviously immediate then
   awareness of objective states must also be immediate.
5. \therefore We are immediately aware of the states or properties of
   physical objects.

Here Kant displays what he takes to be an advantage of his
[[http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantmeta/#H4][Transcendental Idealism]]. Since
both inner and outer sense depend on intuition, there is nothing special
about inner intuition that privileges it over outer intuition. Both are,
as intuitions, immediate presentations of objects (at least as they
appear). Unfortunately, Kant never makes clear what he means by the term
"immediate" [/unmittelbar/]. This issue is much contested (see
@smit2000). At the very least, he means to signal that our awareness in
intuition is not mediated by any explicit or conscious inference, as
when he says that the transcendental idealist "grants to matter, as
appearance, a reality which need not be inferred, but is immediately
perceived" (A371).

It is not obvious that an external world skeptic would find this
argument convincing, since part of the grip of such skepticism on us
relies on the (at least initially) convincing point that things could
/seem/ to one just as they currently are, even if there really is no
external world causing one's experiences. This may just beg the question
against Kant (particularly premise (2) of the above argument). And
certainly Kant seems to think that his arguments for the existence of
the pure intuitions of space and time in the Transcendental Aesthetic
lend some weight to his position here. Thus Kant is not so much arguing
/for/ Transcendental Idealism here as explaining some of the further
benefits that come when the position is adopted. He does, however,
present at least one further argument against the skeptical objection
articulated above -- viz. the argument from imagination, to which we'll
now turn.

**** ii. The Argument from Imagination

Kant's attempt to respond to the skeptical worry that things might
appear to be outside us while not actually /existing/ outside us appeals
to the role that imagination would have to play to make such a
possibility plausible (A373-4; cf. /Anthropology/, 7:167-8).

  This material or real entity, however, this Something that is to be
  intuited in space, necessarily presupposes perception, and it cannot
  be invented by any power of imagination or produced independently of
  perception, which indicates the reality of something in space. Thus
  sensation is that which designates a reality in space and time,
  according to whether it is related to the one or the other mode of
  sensible intuition.
#+END_QUOTE

What follows is my reconstruction of this argument.

1. If problematic idealism is correct then it is possible for one to
   have never perceived any spatial object but only to have imagined
   doing so.
2. But imagination cannot fabricate -- it can only /re/-fabricate.
3. So, if one has sensory experience of outer spatial objects, then one
   must have had at least one successful perception of an external
   spatial object.
4. \therefore It is certain that an extended spatial world exists.

Kant's idea here is that the imagination is too limited to
generate the various qualities that we experience as instantiated in
external physical objects. Hence, it would not be possible to simply
/imagine/ an external physical world without having been originally
exposed to the qualities instantiated in the physical world, /ergo/ the
physical world must exist. Even Descartes seems to agree with this,
noting in /Meditation I/ that "[certain simple kinds of qualities] are
as it were the real colours from which we form all the images of things,
whether true or false, that occur in our thought" (@descartes1984,
13-14). Though Descartes goes on to doubt our capacity to know even such
basic qualities given the possible existence of an evil deceiver, it is
notable that the deceiver must be something other than ourselves, in
order to account for all the richness and variety of what we experience
(however, see /Meditation VI/ (@descartes1984, 54), where Descartes
wonders whether there could be some hidden faculty in ourselves
producing all of our ideas).

Unfortunately, it isn't clear that the argument from imagination gets
Kant a conclusion of the desired strength, for all that it shows (if it
shows anything) is that there was /at one time/ a physical world, which
affected one's senses and provided the material for one's sense
experiences. This might be enough to show that one has not always been
radically deceived, but it is not enough to show that one is not
/currently/ being radically deceived. Even worse, it isn't even clear
that we need a /physical/ world to generate the requisite material for
the imagination. Perhaps all that is needed is /something/ distinct from
the subject, which is capable of generating in it the requisite sensory
experiences, whether or not they are veridical. This conclusion is thus
compatible with that "something" being Descartes's evil demon, or in
contemporary epistemology, with the subject's being a
[[http://www.iep.utm.edu/brainvat/][brain in a vat]]. Hence, it is not
obvious that Kant's argument succeeds in refuting the skeptic, or to the
extent that it does, that it shows that we know there is a /physical/
world, as opposed merely to the existence of something distinct from the
subject.

*** Lessons of the Paralogisms

Beyond the specific arguments of the Paralogisms and their conclusions,
they present us with two central tenets of Kant's conception of the
mind. First, that we cannot move from claims concerning the character or
role of the first-person representation =<I>= to claims concerning the
nature of the referent of that representation. This is a key part of his
criticism of rational psychology. Second, that we do not have privileged
access to our self as compared with things outside us. Both the self (or
its states) and external objects are on par with respect to intuition.
This also means that we only have access to ourselves as we /appear/,
and not as we fundamentally, metaphysically, /are/ (cf. B157). Hence,
according to Kant, our self-awareness, just as much as our awareness of
anything distinct from ourselves, is conditioned by our sensibility. Our
intellectual access to ourselves in apperception, Kant argues, does not
reveal anything about our metaphysical nature, in the sense of the kind
of /thing/ that must exist to realize the various cognitive powers that
Kant describes as characteristic of a being capable of apperception
(e.g. a spontaneous understanding or intellect).
